I enjoy experimenting with compositions and colors; pots gives me many surfaces to play with. My pottery is made out of low-fire red terracotta clay. I use one of two glazing techniques; I either cover the pot with a white slip, underglaze colors and clear glaze or I use white majolica glaze and overglaze colors. I use both hand-building and wheel-throwing techniques."

As a student at Bristol University in the early 1970′s, Mark read Bernard Leach’s “A Potter’s Book,” and decided to become a studio potter rather than an industrial manager. This decision led to a three-year apprenticeship with Michael Cardew, and later another with Todd Piker in Connecticut, where Mark met his wife, Carol. In 1983 they moved to Pittsboro NC and set up their pottery. Mark built a very large wood kiln and began making the distinctive functional pots for which he is known, specializing in very large planters and jars, along with finely made smaller items. He uses local clays and blends the different North Carolinian folk traditions together into a contemporary style that has attracted a sizeable following. Mark’s work has been featured in numerous publications including the Smithsonian magazine, the cover of American Craft magazine, and he has written extensively in the ceramic press. Mark has exhibited in London, New York and Tokyo, as well as throughout the US. He is well-represented in museum and private collections."

    "bio": "My pots and tiles are made with a specific intent – a function. Plates, cups and tiles are ubiquitous, recognizable. The vases and their multiple spouts are curious when empty, when filled with flowers their function is revealed. The tile is a background or canvas. The cup provides a counterpoint – the curves and movement of the form interact with the surface pattern and imagery. The parameters of the functional pot simultaneously create boundaries and endless possibilities. Ideas come from different places; a book, a conversation or a glimpse of something familiar like a favorite historical pot that can seem new, as if seen for the first time. The studio space is where the concepts and inspiration take shape and become tangible and dimensional. The concept of unity with variety is important. For example, combining soft marks and volumes with crisp edges and lines. I am interested in creating contrasting gestures that can coexist within a pot or a tile through mark making, symmetry and repeated patterns. As a student I was drawn to ceramics for its apparent connections with and veneration of “women’s work”. The deep history of clay seemed to reveal connections between women and the material, taking shape in depictions of domestic rituals and ancient fertility goddesses. This history of ceramics and its connections with slow, methodical work – less visible yet necessary for the survival of societies – has often been marginalized to the more dominant narratives of ceramics in 20th century art: one of heroic virtuosity and singular objects"

Cathi imbued this hands-on study with formal arts training at Kwantlen College (1980 – 81) and the Fraser Valley College (1986 – 88). Over the years, Cathi’s desire for learning and improvement has taken her to workshops around the world, with residencies at The Archie Bray Foundation in Montana and others in BC, Banff, Maine, Japan and the UK. Cathi has taught clay at the University of Victoria since moving to the Island in 2007.  She has also taught at Emily Carr College of Art and Industrial Design and the Kootenay School of Art as well as  given many hands-on demonstrations at workshops and conferences throughout North America, the UK and Korea.  Cathi was awarded the 2010 Carter Wosk BC Creative Award for Applied Art and Design."

As I carve into the pot, I consider how a ladder might stand in front of a vine, how a moon might overhang a building, and what would happen if a moon was on the ground. I improvise with myself each step of the way, trying to catch myself unawares. What would happen if I did this? Did that work? Is it clumsy? Can I make it more graceful? Does it still stand evenly? These concerns are fundamental. I believe objects we live with should be made properly. The underside of a handle should be comfortable, curves should be confident. Feet should be well finished. Drawings should make sense, within the context of the pot they live on. When the pots are finished, people are often uncertain of their original material. They recognize time spent, and respond to the surface, but for comprehension, my pieces demand interaction. It is in handling that utilitarian underpinnings are understood. It is in carving that the drawing comes alive, and it is in use that the pieces come alive."

Teapots celebrate our tea drinking ritual; a pitcher adorns the mantel when not in use; a mug with slight texture inside the handle allows our fingers to discover uniqueness. Pottery is a reflection and celebration of ourselves. I always wonder, how am I nourished by where I live? I find utilitarian pottery the best method to express my ideas. Handmade pottery is naturally rich in ideas and metaphor; pottery seeps into our houses, our kitchens, and enriches our lives. Pottery weaves into our daily lives through use and decorates our living spaces with character and elegance; pottery is joyous. Pottery is a reflection of our reality, our fantasy and ourselves. I make pottery out of porcelain clay. It is extremely sensitive and responsive to the human touch when it’s soft; when fired it becomes dense and strong. It is this responsive nature of clay that continues to interest me. It responds to your touch, then you respond to it. The same happens in the firing process with glaze materials and the atmosphere of the kiln. Clay is a supportive and demanding medium for the creative journey of making. I am insistent about making things with my hands. The need for beautiful domestic objects and the instinctual drive to create things are tremendous dance partners for idea and desire. Utilitarian pottery supports and represents our intimate rituals of nourishment and celebration."

    "bio": "I make wood fired utilitarian pottery. Behind the creation of these vessels are several driving philosophies. These philosophies guide all aspects of my work. I believe in making pots for everyday use, that work well for the functions intended. My work is made in harmony with the choice of firing method. Firing with wood has several inherent qualities. These kilns have a distinct wind and directionality to them. The pots I make are made of clay bodies that are reactive to variations in temperature and atmosphere. The wood produces ash, which lands on the pots and melts, forming a naturally occurring glaze. The structural qualities of the pots, in form and texture, are made to catch wood ash, controlling and encouraging the pooling of this glaze. My work is made in dialogue with the effects of the kiln. As each body of work is fired, questions are answered and new ones are posed in a progressive conversation with the firing technique. Wood firing is a process rich in variables. I believe in making the pots with a revelation of process. I integrate throwing lines and evidence of human touch into surface design; I do not hide attachments of handles or spouts. I seek the inherent qualities in the marks different tools make and I approach each individual pot with a similar feel though the tool might differ. This revelation of process harmonizes with the choice of wood firing. Ware from a wood kiln speaks loudly about its making. I also seek to express integrity of emotion. Each pot holds an exploration of mood, as I harmonize the foot of the pot with the rim and the handle with the spout, in an attempt to create a unified work. Much of my work reflects a playful humor that pervades my life, and feeds my spirit. Utilitarian pots may never be part of an avant-garde; a cup lacks the shock value typically associated avant-garde movements. Yet artistic potters are privy to a unique and subversive role in contemporary art; whereas much of 20th Century art has been an attempt to merge art and life, pulling Art out of museums, or bringing life into the setting of the museum, the functional pot continues to hold a place in everyone’s home. It is in the home, rather than an artistic institution, that I feel we potters should exploit. A cup is one of the first things we hold in morning, and often one of the last things we touch at night. By reintroducing artistic ware into the home we can reconnect art and the everyday. –Simon Levin"

Linking process to concept, I combine traditional ceramic techniques with ideas referencing Minimalism and Modernism.

I began covering my pottery forms in flowers to reclaim a language of decoration. Flowers blossom, compete, and sometimes unite as they traverse my vessels, creating a dialogue between form and surface. They are part of an ongoing conversation about embedded values, neglected vs. celebrated histories, and the transformative role functional objects can play in communities. My work has shifted over the past decade as the public debate around environmental justice has come into sharper focus, and I have become increasingly invested in these issues. I have moved from purely symbolic language to using flora to investigate themes of loss, shifting landscapes, and environmental change. Our impact on the environment and declining biodiversity can be difficult to comprehend in the abstract, but focusing attention on an endangered, forest wildflower can evoke an intimate sense of loss. Most recently, I approached environmental change through a scientific lens, using data visualization techniques to inform the surface design. Data points become decorative marks that use the language of line, color, and form to record the impacts of human activity."

Her pots are thrown on a wheel, and altered intentionally by her before being altered rather randomly by the kiln. Therefore they show both the marks of her hands and the effects of the intense heat in the firing process. In a world that is fast paced and oriented toward convenience rather than quality of life, hand made functional pots can slow things down and help the user enjoy the moment as well as inject a little bit of beauty into daily living."

I strive to make small intimate pieces whose design and texture invite you to hold them. There is something about birds that speaks to me. The contradictory aspects of their bodies intrigue me. I find the exquisite detail of their claws and the patterning of their feathers very satisfying. I perch them on my containers to encourage contemplation and conversation. Currently I work solely in porcelain and mix my own glazes. I am fascinated with creating surfaces that mimic nature such as lichen, stones, or tree bark. Many of my pieces are designed as flower containers and are intended to reflect and compliment the natural environment they inhabit."

Hayne’s interest in clay started in high school, where he discovered an old potter's wheel and kiln gathering dust in a corner of the art room. The art teacher pointed him to Bernard Leach's A Potter's Book, which became his guide. After a college career that spanned four schools and seven attempted majors over 12 years, Hayne emerged with a degree in journalism. He worked as a newspaper reporter and editor in New Haven for 10 years. His interest in clay reemerged, and making pots began to take up most of his time outside the newsroom. He quit the paper in 1992 and several days later put out work at a churchyard craft show, where he sold three pieces. Hayne has had the great fortune to be awarded the top prizes at two of the country's most important craft shows: the Smithsonian Craft Show in Washington, D.C. and the Philadelphia Museum of Art Craft Show.

My work is no longer just about utility, they are a wider range of ideas.  But I always strive to make beautiful pots, however they may be used or be enjoyed.  And this raises the bar quite high.  I make many forms, using both the wheel and hand building. I love to make cups that perfectly fit both the hand and the lip.  I think bowls can serve well or simply delight from where they sit.  My traditional thrown vessels and vases are simple in form and wonderfully rich in glazing opportunities.  The most complicated forms are the gestural and dancing teapots and highly altered and sculpted vase forms."

My fingerprints act as a brush stroke on the surface of the clay, each pinch making a formal impression of the hand that created it.

I would describe myself as a functional potter who loves to embellish form and surface.  I have discovered using repetition of the same form facilitates new ideas.  You might compare it to an old Eastern view of life, as seen in Tai Chi (a repetition of sixty-four movements) that out of the repetition of the same form comes new form.

I want my pots to be well designed and comfortable to use; to be rich with ceramic wonder, and seductive to behold; and to have reference to history and the field of ceramic art to spark the imagination. I’m drawn to the beauty and mystery of high temperature ceramics and the element of chance that occurs in the firing, in the subtle qualities of raw clays and the vibrant depths of a transparent glaze. I have a passion for painting with ceramic materials on a three-dimensional form, and having the rhythm of the pattern unfold as it moves around the pot. I enjoy the phenomenon of the melt and the quality of color and depth that develops through the glaze. The loss of control is important, blurring the initial pattern made with the hand. The viscosity, depth, and movement of the glaze are important elements in the final surface. Perhaps pottery’s greatest power lies in its association with the human body. The language of pottery is the language of the body, with necks and feet, bellies and shoulders, and lips to touch our lips. The intimate relationship that develops with use strengthens this association. A personality develops, and the pots become our friends. In this friendship they become reflections of our humanness, and help give meaning to our lives."

    "bio": "Signs of fragility, vulnerability and individuality are exposed in the handmade object. I am interested in how individuality is expressed in an object and the way hand making humanizes it. The early European porcelains of Meissen and Sèvres are my reference - but these symbols of perfection eliminate the mark of the maker. Disrupting, simplifying and transforming these objects with the imperfect touch create a bare essential caricature, exposing a raw rudeness. My ceramics investigate how rapid sketching becomes more animate and anthropomorphic with repetition and how this translates into sculptures of pottery. Exploring the idea of the pot as a relic, womb or container, certain elements become pivotal. Specifically, the opening may resemble the sore flush of a wound or the lure of an orifice, similarly, the belly may be a bulging paunch swollen with imaginary contents, held insecurely above a slender stem to emphasise it’s frailty. Interacting with the material is a two way process. My practice of making, destroying and remaking parallels cycles of decay and renewal. I build, soak, push, squeeze, break, cut, tear and repair. To destroy and rebuild causes a lack of control, which adds motion to the making. The visible construction is similar to that of drawing, erasing and adjusting.Porcelain is chosen for its purity, sensitivity, movement during the firing and its paradoxical qualities of fragility and strength. Up to ten layers of coloured, transparent slips are painted to form a skin-like membrane. Digitally printed ceramic transfers, together with glaze and gold leaf allude to the porcelain’s history.The sources for the still lives include the distorted, decaying, bawdy fruits of Luis Meléndez, the compositions of Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin and the painterly qualities of Paul Gauguin."

I turned it down because I wanted to keep it. Certain I was destined to be a painter, I enrolled in the Memphis Academy of Art. A required class in clay and a chance to throw at the kickwheel, however, caused me to reconsider. The next year, after a few more classes, everyone knew if you wanted to find me, the clay studio was where I’d be. To immerse myself even more, I spent my summers in the early 60s, taking classes at the well-respected Haystack Mountain School of Crafts in Maine. After graduating with my BFA from the Memphis Academy, I moved to New York to earn my Masters in Art from Alfred University. With my degree in hand, I moved back to Tennessee to open my first studio. After several summers spent teaching at the Penland School of Craft, I realized the North Carolina mountains were calling me. Although there were only a few studios in existence at the time, I had a sense it would become a community of artists. I have been living in the Penland Community since 1970. I feel honored to be recognized as the unofficial Mayor of Penland. My work continues to be primarily wheel thrown. I suspect there will never come a day when I’m not fascinated by how each piece takes shape. The same holds true for the excitement I feel opening the gas or wood kiln after a firing. There’s simply no detail about the process, whether trimming, altering or glazing, that I don’t enjoy. I know I am privileged to live in this magical place where I am constantly inspired by nature’s wonders as well as so many amazing potters who either live nearby or take classes here. The years have passed quickly, but the one thing that never changes or diminishes is my joy of transforming an ordinary lump of clay into  beautiful, functional objects that enrich my customers’ everyday experiences. The studio is always open. If you want to learn more, come on over for a visit. You’ll find me at the wheel, happy to share my experiences."

    "bio": "For us, the best pots come out of the interaction between maker, materials, and process. In the transformation from raw clay to finished pots, respecting and loving each component allows its character to participate in the outcome. This strengthens the pot with honesty, while tempering the imposition of too much “me.” We choose our materials and tools very carefully, encouraging a natural vitality that stimulates our curiosity. The clay excites the making...moving as if it is alive, and cutting with freshness from its coarse and rich nature. We make it by the slip method, mixing in a large tank and air drying it in racks. Our current clay uses about one third native materials, enlivening its commercial components with indescribable complexity. Knowing that process and tools have subtle but powerful impacts on pots, to help us get the feeling we wanted, we took cues from potters of the past. All of our methods and tools sprang originally from those that formed the pots we loved. Also, aesthetic choices made by our teachers and predecessors gave us a foundation for how we see pots. Then, over many years of applying our ever-changing personal preferences, each pot we make sets the basis for the next. The satisfying junction of human lip and cup rim, the inner fullness of a bowl, the subtle angles of cut feet that lift and ground a pot…these are ancient values established by traditional potters and with luck, carried forward by those of us who still love to make pots."

I try to create atmosphere with my tableware. Considerations about mood or atmosphere contribute to the overall look and feel of my pieces. Ideas come easily, but meaning seems to come in layers over decades of time. It is meaning that gives strength to good ideas. I hope that my ideas have grown with my skills. I am concerned with ritual as well. Rituals uncover the basic values, aims and attitudes of a people. I am half Sicilian and half Cajun, whose cultures are wrought with superstitions. Throw in a Catholic upbringing and I have rituals dancing all about me. Cooking has given me an avenue to explore and create my personal rituals. I began to cook when I was a teenager, and it has been a strong, sustaining interest in my life. Currently I am interested in the notions of hospitality. Hospitality, which means to give and to receive. I view pottery as a vehicle of hospitality, because a pot gives and receives simultaneously; it is both host and guest."

My textures give the form a costume- dressed up in style with images from nature superimposed on dots and waves. The glaze I am using runs and pools into the recesses to enhance the textures."

Making the work starts with a three-dimensional division of space, continues with drawing on the surface, and finishes with the addition of color.      New ideas are gradually incorporated into previous bodies of work through making. Source information for my pots can be motivated by something as simple as looking at the patterns in the stacked bricks of my kiln to something as complex as the forms in 18th century European manufactured silver.       I experience the evolution of my work through creative repetition in the studio. I am interested in having my work display both practical and extravagant attributes. I am drawn to work that is rich in ornamentation, with lavish use of materials- both scarce in a culture of mass production.     Functional pottery, in its connection to sustenance, closely relates to the human body, revealing what it means to be human. Handmade pots are potent in their power to reveal the extraordinary, within the ordinary. I am driven by the insatiable pursuit of the “good pot”. Successful in terms of tactile, visual, and functional attributes; lastingly significant when packed with the passion of the maker- reflecting humanity, and contributing to the craft."

We both spent many years teaching, giving workshops, and selling our own hand made pottery, supported in part by a few amazing non-profit art centers like The Clay Studio in Philadelphia. We met in 2010, and from the beginning the goal was to spend every day together in the studio. Now we know this idea is not everyone’s cup of tea, but for us, building a creative life centered on making beautiful and useful things became doubly amazing once we were building it together. In 2017 we decided to combine our creative forces into one single business. An enthusiastic response to a first round of planters gave us the courage to just go for it.

The minute I felt the spin of the wheel and the clay in my hands, I knew I had found my medium of expression. Creating forms in clay is like writing secret things in your journal. Important aspects of your life make their way to find a life on written pages. After several years, animal forms seemed to surface. I have spent a lifetime with animals around me, so that was understandable — but there was more. Sometimes it’s more about the penmanship, the way the words are written, that tells more about what is being said than the words themselves. If you observe my work closely, you will find bits and pieces of an imaginary world working itself up to say “SURPRISE!” That may happen as a life-size stork looks you in the face, as a tiny mouse circles its way off the handle of a teacup, or when you find out that the pig is not only a sculpture, but a functional teapot. Behind the words, there is an invitation to take a breath. Observe. Laugh. Find the innocent part of yourself that can find itself lost. This is what the work does for me as I have the opportunity to create it, and why I think in its own way it is a Journal to save the world."

Often plant life, erotics, and references to the landscape are present. It is also important to me that my work is visibly strong and durable, so that it invites touch and use.

I work until I think I like it and then I might stop. I am greedy for complicated textures, movable doors and drawers, multiple stamped images and unusual glazes that I develop through obsessive testing. For years ethnic ritual objects have influenced me. With my abiding interests in unusual surfaces and ritual presence, I have made altars, teapots, tableware, multi-layered mosaics and tiles. \nCurrently I am interested in functional ware. I paint three layers of colored slip on soft slabs. Sometimes I use newspaper to resist the colors, other times I spatter colors as a final step. I carve out bits, turn them upside-down and inlay them like fossils. The rich mix of colors, inlaying carved out colored pieces in new places give me painterly slabs of color to make into plates, bowls, cups, vases and teapots.\nPrevious phases in my work have included gas firing for thrown functional stoneware, metallic salts on porcelain, saggar firing with eggshells and kelp, electric fired lichen like surfaces, and glaze testing that produced unusual ceramic colors that were toxic, non-functional and undependable but very interesting. This present period is a change; the new functional work is microwave and dishwasher safe. Is this what happens when you become a grandmother?"

Marriage, fertility, creation, death and the difference between the numinous and pure materiality are the essential primary subjects related to human experience that occur and reoccur in my work. Much of the work is dichotomous in nature; being both sensual and cerebral, organic & geometric, solid & weightless, masculine & feminine. In the end, whether it might be a vase on a table, an empty coin bank, the bowl on the night stand, a burial urn or a ballot box, what could be more natural than to put something.....meaning....... in a vessel?"

    "bio": "Anja's work explores the smooth, translucent and pure material properties of porcelain, through experimental manipulation of the soft clay surface. Some pieces are made in  a variety of other clays, rough and black or cracking up as layers are breaking the rules of traditional ceramic technique. Figurative details are taken from religious figurines, the human body and ornamental surfaces. These are then transferred as delicate 3D relief back onto the wheel thrown vessel walls, appearing to push through the surface of the vessels with a sense of animation and metamorphosis. The metaphorical textures and forms are evocative and the viewer will create their own narrative, depending on personal memory and imagination. Some work features ceramic transfers, for decoration or story telling."

    "bio": "My work is thrown and burnished using many layers of a fine terra-sigillata slip with resist and inlay decoration. I began working with sigillata to develop a rich surface with a combination of form and pattern that would be integral to the clay. Starting with line and dense burnishing, I experimented to obtain a feeling of depth, allowing the smoke process to play its essential and unpredictable part. I am searching for development that comes from themes and variations; allowing the ideas to flow from one group of work to the next, adding and omitting to arrive at a natural relationship of surface to form. The challenge lies in the relationship of form and pattern. Balance, rhythm and proportion are all important. With the development of a tonal range in the use of terra-sigillata I have been able to introduce depth to the surface. It is the combination of the fundamental and the sophisticated that I find fascinating. My vessel forms are represented in the collections of the Victoria and Albert and Fitzwilliam Museums and the Walker Art Gallery among many others in the UK as well as notable collections abroad.The rich, intriguing surface effects do not, like glaze, separate the making and the firing. These are pots which work on the boundaries of primitivism yet are highly sophisticated, they please because they defy definition, they are pots on the edge, a satisfying and intriguing blend of technical skill and creative vision.

    "bio": "In 1986, I moved from New York City to rural Western Massachusetts to make pots and build a wood kiln. I was able to buy a shipwreck of an old place that has an unusual feature from which I took the name for my pottery—a stone pool that Russell Conwell, turn-of-the-century preacher and educator and founder of Temple University in Philadelphia had built in 1893. The farmhouse, where Conwell was born, is rich in history—it had been a stop on the Underground Railroad during Conwell’s childhood, and he remembered John Brown and Frederick Douglass staying at the house. While working on the place, I dug up a shard of a gray salt-glazed four-gallon crock that happened to have the makers’ stamp on it. “Hastings and Belding, Ashfield Mass.” It turned out to have been made only about 15 miles from my home and studio, at the middle of the last century. It got me thinking about pots that were made, bought, used, broken and disposed of within a specific region and the connection this implies between the community of users and makers. It led to my decision to move and restore the old shed (the one where fugitive slaves had slept) for use as a gallery to welcome local people at the pottery. It also prompted a deeper interest in early New England potters and their wares. In particular, the pots made from 1790–1830, wonderful swelling volumes of ovoid forms with their firing scars and flashing, spoke to me as powerful vernacular objects. Before moving to Western Massachusetts, I had been living in New York and making sculpture while supporting myself as a carpenter. The turn to pottery answered the vexing problem that I had been unable to resolve with my sculpture: Where does the stuff go? On a pedestal in patron’s living room? In front of a building? In a museum storage vault? As a potter, on the other hand, my work would be held and used; it would stay in the main places of people’s lives. And, I could control most aspects of creative production—the concept, making, finishing, marketing and selling of the work, in a process and within a scale that preserves and enhances the humanity of the creative experience. As my work has evolved I continue to be compelled by the challenges of domestic pottery, but I have also recently become interested as in making larger scale work that is more appropriate to the scale and abstractness gallery space than the kitchen."

His bold and imaginative pieces have been heavily influenced by early Staffordshire Creamware, while taking their own unique formations. Walter believes his work grows from his passion for ‘pots from the past’ and the joy of making and firing itself. Sometimes making simple, useful, things like mugs or jugs, while on other occasions creating pieces that are a lot less straightforward. These pieces make demands, challenging the user to negotiate with an unexpected pot that seeks to do an ordinary job. “I hope my pottery brings with its seriousness some humour and sensual pleasure.” – Walter Keeler"

After graduating and serving in the army, Ed married Evalyn in the Monongahela river valley, the same river valley where his studio now resides. Edinboro had a rigorous studio arts curriculum, and it was in undergraduate school that Ed fell in love with clay as an infinite medium of possibility. His most popular artwork is comprised entirely of high fire clay where Ed paints directly onto porcelain forms as a canvas, using terra sigillata and other mixtures. In the late 1960’s ceramics and sculpture programs at Alfred University in upstate New York had a growing reputation. This attracted Ed, with all of the faculty and innovations happening there. Eberle was accepted to the MFA program at Alfred and studied under Bob Turner, Val Cushing, Ted Randall and Bill Parry. Also, Ed was a studio assistant for Daniel Rhodes and gained valuable experience from all of the faculty. After graduating from Alfred in 1972, and now a father of two sons, Eberle relocated his family to teach fine art and ceramics at the Philadelphia College of Art, and again in 1975 with Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, PA. Even though his teaching career lasted only fourteen years, Ed developed a following of undergrad and graduate students, with an inclusive teaching style and studio mentorship. He would bring innovative lecturers to Carnegie Mellon including: M.C. Richards, Howard Yana-Shapiro and Joseph Campbell (The Power of Myth). In 1985 Ed left teaching at Carnegie Mellon and began working exclusively as a studio artist, working primarily in: painting, drawing, sculpture and ceramics for a prolific career that now spans 40 years. Eberle also creates art installations, and occasionally has portfolios in book-making, print-making and lithography. In addition to many one-man shows in New York, Chicago and Pittsburgh galleries, Ed has had several one-man exhibitions at the Carnegie Museum of Art and also the Columbus Museum of Art. Mr. Eberle’s artwork is represented in museum collections internationally including: The National Gallery of Australia, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Nelson-Atkins Art Museum, Smithsonian American Art Museum, Carnegie Museum of Art, Gardiner Museum Ontario, Contemporary Art Museum Hawaii, Museum of Art Houston and Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.

I intend to create work where there is a similarity between pieces but everything is unique in some way. Variability is one of the potter’s strength in terms of designing work. Crafting an eclectic array of dishes is a response to the ubiquity of objects sold through chain stores."

Most of my work is made from white stoneware and porcelain clay using a variety of forming techniques, including wheel-throwing, slab-building and slip-casting. Strong clean forms, with soft corners and planes are great for experimentation with line-drawing, texture and color. The surface is created by incising and carving, and brushing, stenciling, and trailing slip. The glaze and underglaze materials vary the line quality and colors. By applying the glazes to selected areas with a brush, some areas can be shiny, while others remain softly matte."

I am influenced by the surrounding colors and textures and how combinations fall into the patterns that occur in nature.

When used in conjunction with the right glazing techniques it can achieve a state where it visually approaches glass. Crystalline glazes often achieve this effect developed on simple economical forms. A good analogy to the way crystals form on a ceramic piece, is the way frost forms on a window pane. Frost is water vapor gathering at particles of dust and forming ice crystals. This phenomenon will only take place when all the conditions to do so are ideal.”"

The dance back and forth between the two types of work keeps my interest in both alive.  Nature and my life’s process are sources of ideas and inspiration. I will always love “the bowl” and my recent dialog with clay has led me to focus on it again, not as a strictly functional object, but as the concept of universal container and symbol of nurture. It’s the process more than the resulting object that I love best.  Marks of this process are always evident in my pieces so that in a way each piece tells the story of its creation. I have maintained a working studio in Austin for 21 years.  My work is available in galleries, at art shows and from my studio."

His search for glazes that would not compete with the form led him to a red shino glaze, discovered while at the Baltimore Clayworks. It took him over a year to perfect his technique which involved starving the kiln of oxygen to create smoke. This glaze is often called “Malcolm’s shino.” He shared the formula for this glaze and it quickly became a sensation in the pottery world.      Davis first touched clay in 1974 at age 37 and became a full-time studio potter in 1984 when he left his previous career as a campus minister. His work was inspired by diverse folk traditions from early Korean to Native American pottery."

Use is an important concern in my work, but I try not to view utility in a narrow context.  A pot can function well without aspiring to the smooth, regular forms of industrially-pressed hotel china.  A pot can be functional without being conventional.  My work is functional without implying simplicity, streamlining, production speed, or boredom. I am not trying to move beyond function or to free myself from it but to expand your idea of what a functional pot can be. In my work I try to soften the Apollonian precision of a structured, clearly articulated form by contrasting it with Dionysian elements of swelling, curvilinear volume.  My choice of glazes combines with firing decisions to transform an initially structured surface into an atmospheric veil of sublime color.  I hope the contrast between classical and romantic elements of form and surface will intensify the experience of both aesthetics by presenting them in the context of their visual opposites"

Most pieces are slip cast and then often altered, added on to, or reconstructed in some way. I use a mid-range white casting slip. I have made many different types of pottery over my career, but have always been interested in the way decorative elements can be used to enhance a form, whether one is using an elaborate pattern or the simplest marks. The decorative elements of my work are influenced by the natural world. I was brought up to always notice and take joy in nature. I have lived my whole life in a rural environment. My images are usually of grasses, leaves, flowers, and nowadays birds. I grew into the bird imagery years after my father, a well known landscape and bird painter passed away. I have always been attracted to certain qualities of the decorative arts in Asia. I attribute this to living next door to the Nelson Atkins Museum in Kansas City while in Art School there. More recently two long working sojourns in China, which gave me abundant access to seeing Yuan and Han Dynasty ritualistic forms, influenced the sculptural aspects of my pieces. My glazing method is the use of multiple layers of compatible glazes, using wax resist and liquid latex to create a kind of visual depth."

The use of satirical humor, irony and sarcasm often provides a seductive vehicle to approach issues of gender and sexuality within my work. The combination of narrative presented on the surface, united with the intended utility of each vessel, allows a dialogue between the essence of the object and its narrative.

It is just off Busbee Road, a road named for Jacques and Juliana Busbee, the founders of Jugtown. Both artists with a love of craft and form, together they created Jugtown Pottery, melding forms from ancient traditions with those developed in North Carolina. In 1917 they created The Village Store and Tea Room in New York City, and in 1922 they began stamping each piece with the circular Jugtown Ware stamp. The forms derive from simplicity and practice, a continuous line, then a complimentary glaze and occasional decoration. Drawing from the North Carolina tradition, you will find jugs, pitchers and candlesticks in wood fired Salt Glaze and Frogskin, and tablewares in green, blue, brown and gray. Vases, bowls and jars in glazes made with wood ash, local clays, copper reds, greens and iron earth tones, have origins in world clay traditions. Jugtown thrives on the aesthetic foundation laid out by the Busbee's. Vernon Owens, recipient of the NC Folk Heritage Award and the NEA National Heritage Fellowship, wife Pam, son Travis and daughter Bayle are the main potters; while Bobby Owens mixes clay and glazes the pieces."

As my investment in the pottery process began to take hold I dug into history, embracing the relationship between man and clay and fire.  A connection was struck the day I happened upon a grainy black and white photograph of a medieval Syrian pot that bore a striking resemblance to something my fresh and sophomoric hands had made earlier that day.  Just a sloppy little form with ambiguous anatomy, a wobbly foot, a lumpy belly, a twisted neck, finishing with a pouring edge raised by the happenstance of an imperfectly pulled wall. In that moment I reached across an ocean and thru time to make a connection with this Syrian potter and his lumpy little pot made a millennium ago.  Imagining the longevity of the lumpy little pot in my own studio and its potential to communicate with others I felt that I had become part of something large and important.  My investigation as a maker of pottery continues to be informed by this experience."

For most of his career, Kline has worked with wood-fired salt-glazed stoneware, usually with organic patterns painted on a thick white slip surface, glass”runs,” and an alkaline ash glaze. As a resident at Penland (1998 - 2001), he began making large pots inspired by the traditional stoneware of Catawba Valley and Seagrove, North Carolina. He also briefly experimented with translucent porcelain in 2000, the floral patterns becoming a raised, topographical feature. In 2015 he visited the Freer-Sackler Wing of the Smithsonian and was struck by 15th C. examples of the Korean sangam technique. Since then, he has focused on applying this technique to his own work and aesthetic, creating floral stamps and inlaying the impressions with white slip on a dark stoneware base, and firing in a gas kiln. This new body of work currently makes up a thirdof his output. Kline’s work is consistently identifiable in its delicate pattern systems contrasted with robust forms and somewhat coarse materials. Kline began working with clay in college, and while he initially pursued a civil engineering degree, he graduated with a BFA in Ceramics in 1986. He taught at the Westside YMCA in New York (1986 - 1989) before attending a Michael Simon Workshop at Penland School of Crafts (Penland, NC) in 1989. Following the workshop, he became a full time studio potter, sharing a work space with Mark Shapiro and Sam Taylor in Western Massachusetts (1988 - 1998). In 1998, he came back to Penland as a Resident Artist. Following his residency, he set up a studio in nearby Bakersville, where he continues to work today. He has taught numerous workshops across the country, and in 2000 was a presenter at the Utilitarian Clay Conference at Arrowmont School of Crafts (Gatlinburg, TN)."

Their studio and gallery, nestled in the mountain ridges on the way to Roan Mountain, is 6 miles from downtown Bakersville, in western North Carolina. Visiting their studio, you will find two distinctive styles of pottery. Kent works in stoneware and porcelain clay using traditional glazes, fired in a gas -reduction kiln to 2380 degrees F. His work is decorated using a \"wax resist\" technique, layering glazes as he applies distinctive brushwork. Suze's stoneware pots subtly suggest anthropomorphic form and character as she manipulates by altering, stacking and combining parts to create functional forms with personality. Suze decorates her pieces by patterning and painting slips and glazes, and then fires the pieces in her salt kiln. They share a passion for working with their hands, and for making pots for everyday use that are well crafted and a pleasure to use. That use can range from a mug for your first cup of coffee in the morning, to lighting the candelabra for an intimate dinner."

Our goal is to pursue and promote the creativity, diversity, and excellence of functional pottery being made in Philadelphia.  We strive to educate, inspire, and inform the Philadelphia audience and beyond, about this timeless art form. In our work we strive to show the vitality of clay, especially through the use of texture. Most of Neil’s forms begin on the potter’s wheel and are then altered (faceted, ridged, cut and re-assembled.)

    "bio": "Robert Brady’s early abstract coil and pinch built figurative sculptures reference iconic spiritual and mythological imagery. These early porcelain or stoneware figures established his reputation as one of the moving forces in California’s San Francisco Bay area figurative ceramic sculpture movement. The near life-size elongated forms recall the work of sculptor Alberto Giacometti.  As a result of raku firing, the figures have a patina that suggests age. In the late 1970s, Brady produced a series of distorted masks based on Mexican folk sculptures. In the 1980s his influence shifted to the Septic River figures from New Guinea and masks of the Northwest Coast. In the 1970s Brady earned his MFA at UC Davis with Robert Arneson. In 1989 Brady shifted media and began building his figures in wood. After a number of years working with wood, he returned to clay, at first working with terra cotta. At that time he also made a number of functional, wheel thrown vessels decorated with angular line drawings. Brady continues these vessel forms today (2017). On occasion, Brady makes both the clay and wire sculpture pendants with a unique lanyard. Brady continues to create bronze figurative work as well as both abstract ceramic and wood free standing and wall hung sculptures.  Brady is comfortable working with all mediums, wood, clay, and bronze."

Colour is then added as washes which are mixed using a palette of underglaze stains. It’s a real labour of love as the larger pieces can take days or even weeks to get right, but this technique allows her to create her beautiful hand painted porcelain. The aim is to create works of art for galleries, museums, private clients and luxury retailers. Notable clients have included the National Gallery, Jo Malone London and Fortnum and Mason."

These situations provide calmness, a physical as well as mental space that allows me to relax, contemplate, and focus on the important details of my life. The surfaces of the vessels represent the natural world, and the forms often relate to the figure.  Pottery’s inherent relationship to the figure is accentuated in my gestural forms.  The dialog between the forms changes as the pieces are used. The simple things in life are often the most important, the great outdoors, the company of my dog, and the beauty of making pots on a daily basis.  My pots speak of my passions, while at the same time allowing the user to recognize the important things in their own lives."

    "bio": "The functional pottery which I now make is done in a mid-range, cone 3 stoneware, made, at the moment, from my mixing of a commercial clay body with a clay body I have formulated, and mix, myself. This clay, fired to a higher temperature than most maiolica, is a dense, less porous clay which bonds well with, and will not cause the maiolica glaze to chip or craze. This higher temperature maiolica is somewhat of an anomaly, since most work of this type is in the lower temperature range, and, though more colorful, is less durable. The pieces, themselves, are formed with the use of the wheel, slab roller, and hand tools, and bisqued to cone 06 before glazing and decorating. The glaze, which I also mix, is a cone 3 white or cream maiolica, and the colorants, mixed with a frit, a gum and a macloid (the Walter Ostrom method), are brushed onto the glaze in its dusty, pre-fired stage. The decoration is a little like working with watercolors on blotter paper. The frit aids with the fusion; the gum, with ease of brush work; the macloid, with suspension. Once decorated, the pieces are then fired in an oxidizing atmosphere in a large, electric kiln, over a period of 17 hours. Cooling takes another day and a half. My son, Peter, for one of his high school projects, planted a large, bricked-path garden near my studio, with interesting flower and vegetable variants, many of which have inspired my decoration. My family and I have also visited both France and Italy (to see a nephew and his family), and more recently, Finland and Russia , where I have done many drawings, and looked at many pots. The clay notebook series is also an outgroth of the gardening, and of more worldly ideas. Made with porcelain or stoneware fired to the bisque temperature, the work is then cold-smoked, and painted and assembled. These are some of the cumulative results of almost thirty years of looking, drawing, and of working in clay."

Cooking, presenting and sharing a meal, foraging and arranging a bouquet are simple yet deeply satisfying rituals that bolster our humanity. My intent as a studio potter is to engage the viewer to interact with my pots by way of their sensual forms and lush patterned surfaces. The pots function as decorative objects to be activated through use. Interaction with the viewer/user completes their aesthetic potential as they contain, deliver or present food and flowers.  Preparing and presenting an inspired meal or arranging flowers in a specific container, affirms our connection to identity, while elevating domestic rituals from banal to beautiful."

    "bio": "The focus of my work explores the possibility of going beyond the limits of utility. Through the use of color and form, an investigation of the division and the reassembling of disparate elements is considered either for special celebration or for everyday use. I am inspired by the results of process, the interactions of color and form, and the physiognomic perception of an object. In my work, intent of function is vital and inescapable. My goal is to challenge the viewer’s notion of an object’s “use”, while assuring that the vessel performs flawlessly in its function and beautifully in its appearance."

    "bio": "My ceramic works are influenced by European earthenware pottery and porcelain traditions from the 13th through the 18th centuries. Both “peasant” and “palace” pots inspire me. In the former it is the casual, perhaps careless result that excites me: the drip of glaze, the impurities in the clay, the globs of kiln-shelf refuse fused to the bottom. These imperfections often enliven the pot in ways that take my breath away. In the latter, the elaborate rendering of form and surface common to porcelain factories such as Sevres and Spode, fuels my imagination. Early English slipware, Delftware, and Italian maiolica are sources I refer to often.   I am attached to terracotta and low-fired technologies as symbols of my heritage. I like to imagine a potter ancestor in Luxembourg or Wiltshire pouring slip on his earthenware platter, decorating it with the details of some local or family event, sprinkling on lead oxide, then firing it in the most simple manner. He was an essential member of his community, whereas I am at home in the art world. But my ancestor and I are alike in our interest in enlivening the daily aspects of life: mundane routines and community celebrations. Like him, I hope the plates, platters, bowls and other service pieces I make enhance those routines and rituals and that they add a touch of grace to the domestic arena."

    "bio": "I first became interested in pottery when I was in my early twenties living and working in Japan. My eyes opened to the world of the handmade object and I began by starting a modest pottery collection. It was several years later, at a small community studio in New York City, when I took my first pottery class. As luck would have it, my first teacher, Louise Harter, was building a wood kiln for the studio in upstate NY and I became a part of her building crew. I was definitely hooked, and quickly started plotting how I could make pots full time and leave my day job. I loved wood fired pots from the beginning, but I was equally attracted to what I saw as the wood firing potter’s lifestyle. Beautiful kilns and studios out in the country, the balance of indoor and outdoor work, the crackling of the fire, the camaraderie around the kiln – I wanted it all. I began looking for an apprenticeship situation and received a very lucky break when Jeff Shapiro agreed to introduce me to a teacher in Japan. I remember well one November evening in 1993 when Jeff called and said that Bizen master Isezaki Jun was willing to take me into his studio as an apprentice."

    "bio": "I took my first pottery class at the Artists Association of Nantucket Island when I was sixteen. I was there on a family vacation and thought it would be fun to take advantage of the month-long classes they offered to Summer residents.  The class resulted in three or four very heavy, very badly crafted bowls. Much to my horror, they exist somewhere on a shelf in my parents’ house.As a college freshman I spent most of my time in the clay studio creating bowls, mugs and vases. Then life intervened and I went on to pursue both a Bachelor's and a Master's degree in music, putting pottery on the back burner.But the clay bug had bit and while working as a reservations agent for a major airline I decided, on a whim, to take a pottery class. Twenty years later I no longer work for that major airline. Instead, I am pursuing a career as a professional musician and making and marketing wheel-thrown, functional pottery. Over time, my work has evolved to embody simple, clean forms with carved surface designs.  My pots utilize Arts and Crafts-inspired glazes and are fired in a high-fire reduction kiln . Influences include Bernard Leach, Mark Hewitt, Cynthia Bringle and Robin Hopper. My main goal is to produce pottery that is both beautiful and useful. My hope is that my mugs, plates, bowls and pitchers will be used at a table where people come together not only to enjoy a good meal but to discuss, laugh, cry, debate and connect. I am currently a faculty member at The Craft Guild of Dallas. All clays and glazes are non-toxic, and all pottery is dishwasher and microwave safe."

    "bio": "What attracts me to work in clay is that it links me strongly to the past. To know that I work in one of the oldest art forms of human kind, that for millennia people have been working in clay, makes me feel rooted and centered. And it shows in how I work: I throw my pots on a kick wheel and (as often as possible) I fire in wood kilns, using technologies that have not changed significantly for centuries. The forms I choose to make are often anachronistic. My ceramic bottles, for instance, are obsolete in our day, and they hark back to a time when they were used commonly every day. I like piggybanks, because they are traditionally so much a ceramic form, yet in our day of credit cards they are no longer very useful. Because of their obsolescence, I hope my bottles and piggybanks make people reflect on the relationship between our present and our past. It is also this obsolescence that frees them of their functionality, which allows me to explore and experiment with the forms. That same attraction to the past has me intrigued with ritual and religion. Sometimes, I make objects for ritual outright: communion goblets, seder plates, labyrinths, vases for ikebana, to name a few. But more often I make objects that can become part of people's everyday rituals. I cherish the thought that my bowl might become someone's favorite for cereal every morning, or that my tea cup is the one someone reaches for for comfort, or that a set of my dishes might be used to gather together friends for a good meal and conversation. While I am nourished by the past, I am not interested in making pieces that look like old ones. Potters in the past were very much current in their time, and I am part of my present too. Our time is one of individualism and self-expression. And I am, of course, influenced by potters around me. So, in my work I try to maintain a balance between expressing my love of history, tradition, and ritual and making pots that are uniquely mine and current."

When steel is exposed to the elements and rusts creating rich colors of red, oranges, and yellows. These surfaces are all records of time, change, and decay much like the surface of my work in the wood kiln."

The movement of the throwing line, the boldness of a brushstroke or the juxtaposition of the raw clay and the gloss of the glaze.  When a kiln is unloaded and rows of pots are lined up, it might look like they are simply multiples of a form.  But when I am making them, the curve and movement of each piece is obsessed over.  And after they are fired, each piece is completely one of a kind to me.  The flow of the flame on the surface of the pot and the way that the subtitles of the form are enhanced by the firing process always inspires me."

    "bio": "Over the years I have developed methods of working with clay that are meant to bring out the natural qualities of that material and of the process of drying, shrinking, glazing, melting, and firing. By multiple firing, and layering of slips and glazes, I try to make objects that have stratified active surfaces that snap and crackle with energy. I am looking for meaning and content in the dynamics of the process and trying to apply this to my general aesthetic or world view. I am interested in the tension between opposites; between light and dark; male and female; between expansion and contraction; good and evil; organic and geometric; ration and intuition; mind and body; night and day; between our conscious lives and our subconscious self; between matter and spirit. The notion that our lives are bound by a mythic drama that unfolds spontaneously, and that there is an underlying geometry, hidden patterns, and layered meanings to all we see, is a preoccupation that informs much more than just my work. For quite some time now I have been using the figure, the vessel, and the landscape as a primary image (or mythic image) through which I could express some thoughts about the human condition. I have tried to present a unified theme that ties together work that ranges from small scale utilitarian pots to large scale vessels and figures. I work improvisationaly, finding figures in the material, and developing them into an image, or a narrative that seems to have life. I like to think of these figures as part of a family of images that find their way through my hands into the outer world. At their best they present an enigmatic expression, somewhere on the edge between whimsy and fear."

I use the ideals of the vessel to clarify design and explore form as it relates to space. To me working in clay is more about composition, proportion and surface than it is about efficiency of use. The dualities of this medium continually fascinate me. In my process I play with the plasticity of the material and its ability to capture spontaneous movement in form and surface. I then contrast it by introducing hard edges and lines that interrupt and accentuate the flow of that softness. I also want the skin of my pieces to heighten the viewer’s awareness of the interior volume and function as a canvas for color and decoration. My hope is to make pieces that are able to communicate feelings and ideas without recalling specific objects. I intend for these compositions to be mysterious and open-ended enough to evoke multiple interpretations."

I am fascinated how we personalize and define ourselves through the objects we use and accumulate. The clothes we wear, the cars we drive, the things we decorate and furnish our homes with - all of these objects reflect our personality and aesthetic proclivities both publicly and privately. I am interested in the phenomenon of how we look and shop for objects. Once the requirements of fit, occasion, and agency have all been established, (a size 11 running shoe that wears comfortably, for example), to what degree are we further attracted to the point of purchase? Is it the pattern of the shirt, the cut of the dress, or the color of the shoe that makes us want to own that object, or is it simply a matter of cost and convenience? Making pots is a way for me to reflect on the people, places, and experiences, here and gone, that I know, love, and carry with me. Every piece gives me the opportunity to reconnect with those experiences and emotions past and shared. Through this dialogue I hope to share something of myself with you, a smile perhaps; and in doing so, I might make pots that you want to live with."

Trained in the traditional majolica or tin-glaze technique of pottery painting McGowan now applies this knowlege to enhance his thrown stoneware shapes with ever changing brushwork patterns distilled from plant and animal forms. Whilst in no way imatative, these often contain echoes of his interest in the islamic decorative arts and their assimilation into the contemporary vocabulary through the arts and craft movement. Some pots are inscribed, exploring the extra dimension that calligraphy can give to a piece. McGowan's work is represented in many museums and private collections and is used and enjoyed in many houses throughout the world.

Being immersed in parenting and playing with him has affected what I am currently creating. These pieces have elements extracted and interpreted from industrial, agricultural, and nautical containers and objects that I as an adult male have been attracted to, but also new elements from my boys’ toys, which have now permeated my life and space.

    "bio": "The artist's early work in oil, lithography and mixed media created a world of great depth, with a myriad of texture and rhythmic line that celebrates life, the perfect architecture of nature, and form that follows function. Her ceramic art extends the concept of color, line, and texture from the two dimensional world into the reality of three dimensional space. Continuing the exploration of color, depth, texture, and intricate pattern, her ceramics also encompasses a sensual aspect that not only regales the eye but invites the touch. Inspiration by nature to the study of physical forces brings the artist full circle. The expression of beauty in form and function continues only with the understanding and harnessing of these natural forces and the organic markings which are the gift of the fire. The record of the lick of the flame depends on the pot, the clay, the kiln, the placement in the kiln, the fuel, the temperature, the firing schedule, the weather, the cooling and other variables inherent in the firing process. Joyce Michaud's work addresses the interplay of form and finish contrasting the extremes of strength and fragility, matt and gloss, smooth and textured, graceful gesture and harsh reality that reference the delicate balance which is the essence of life itself. Each piece, each firing has its own voice, tells its own story."

    "bio": "Sam Miller started creating bonsai pottery in the fall of 2015.  He is most known to the bonsai community as a yamadori collector.  However, he could never find enough pots to accommodate the trees Sam hauled out of the mountains.  That and he also felt there was a lack of nice round pots available. After buying some really nice nanban-style pots by Jim Gremel, Sam thought, “maybe I could do that”.  He set out to make his own pottery and immediately became obsessed with wheel thrown pottery. Sam enjoys slab building as well, but he is more proficient with the pottery wheel. Sam is known for his high fired oxide stained dark clay pots, always with reduction to bring out the metallic sheen."

    "bio": "My work seeks to combine figurative imagery with the format of the traditional clay vessel. The vessel has historically been a powerful metaphor for the body, with each part of the pot being named for the corresponding area of the body. A full lip, a gentle curve of the neck, a rotund belly or a broad shoulder all combine to provide animation to the pot. Some of my pieces are predominantly male, some are a synthesis of male and female but most are female forms inspired by fertility figures found in most early cultures. The Venus of Willendorf and the stone carvings of the Cycladic culture are some of the most powerful to me. My most recent work strives toward an elegant organic form, one that is obviously a hand-made object but has an internal natural order.     My pieces are coil-built out of terra cotta clay. Coiling allows me to control the form while the joining marks provide an inherent rhythm to the surface. The terra-cotta gives me a warmth to the colors, yet allows a wide choice of finishes. Peeling paint and mossy rocks provide sources of inspiration for the color and textures of my work."

My current body of work consists of a collection of porcelain assemblages. These objects, mostly personal in scale, have been crafted of parts cast from a curious cache of found plaster molds. For these ‘objets d’ art’ I appropriate selections from mundane, anonymously sculpted tchotchkes and figurines and rearrange them into something that in it’s parts is familiar, yet modified into a new context. Not to dismiss the fact that I very carefully and meticulously construct these works of art, I will admit that they are Surrealist in nature as I allow my choices to be automatic and based firstly on whether or not the parts align, untainted by rationalism. There is absurdity and bizarreness to these seamless amalgams. What is the interplay between objects and people? I leave that up to the viewer to decide but I offer my art as a springboard for the imagination."

My work is influenced by the long history of pottery traditions, from British and Japanese folk pottery to primitive Iranian pots, as well as by fabricated metal pouring pots such as oil cans, tin teapots and watering cans. I strive for simplicity and clarity, with a minimum of embellishment. The majority of my work is thrown on the wheel and then stretched, altered, cut and assembled into new shapes. I work slowly and usually in a series, arranging parts, varying proportions and making subtle changes in each firing cycle of pots, always trying to introduce something new. Through this process and search for defining form, I try to develop pieces that are not only functional for food, but which also have the potential to enrich the routines of our home environment and bring beauty to our daily lives."

My Mother was an artist, and we “did” Art almost daily as part of our routine: pencil sketches, pastel drawings, calligraphy, watercolor paintings, and pen and ink.  From that point on, I have always considered Art as an integral part of what makes me who I am.  I am fortunate to have had this way of expression passed on to me by my Mother’s example.     It seemed only natural to become an Art major in college.  After teaching art for a number of years and being laid off due to cutbacks, I had the opportunity to pursue my art on a full-time basis.      I have been a ceramic artist for the past 25 years,working in a variety of clays, techniques, and firing methods.  I am currently working in earthenware - handbuilding sculptural pieces, and wheel throwing and altering most of my functional forms.  All work is glaze fired in an oxidation atmosphere at cone 04 using a combination of textural, crusty glazes, contrasting with smooth drippy glazes, and terra sigillata."

    "bio": "My work is composed to create pause. Functional qualities, visual rhythms, and exaggerated proportions are some of the elements I employ in the objects I make to quietly challenge our preconceived notions and our expectations. Upon investigation, a codified order both mysterious and liberating emerges in my work, and makes it resonate with my intentions. The objects I make are equal parts anthropological study and artistic endeavor, and incorporate an attempt to understand the world we live in, through making. The importance of genuine utility in my work is precluded by the desire to borrow a certain quality of functional items: familiarity. Pottery has an implied invitation. The intentional placement of openings, lids, and handles in my work conveys the specificity of function, clarifying that the objects I make have an intended purpose. The exact function is less obvious, and a situation is created that pairs a sense of knowing with a sense of mystery. The desire to identify the purpose of an object is an open invitation for continued exploration. Scrutiny and inspection reveal both undulations in edges once considered straight and subtle variations on flat planes. These details act as rewards for a heightened level of engagement. The objects I make exhibit a compositional preference for repetition over variety, and I position repeated elements in regular, metered fashion. This allows the eye to travel predictable paths across my work. A rhythm develops, with a cadence that promotes a rambling exploration of the form. Edges and lines are also measured, and they exhibit a confident, grounded quality that guides visual investigation in a steady and considered way. Vessels for containment are, by their own nature, the product of a desire for order. The interior spaces in my work are made special by manipulating access to them, and my vessels most often contain only a rarefied space. Simply reaching the interior, literally or visually, is an event, a private ritual that is a self-justifying endeavor. The composed nature of the objects I make reflects the quiet sentiment of my investigations. My endeavor is a disciplined approach, aimed to augment one's engagement with their surroundings by creating objects that appear to have cryptic lessons in them."

Known for being erudite and irreverent, Merino's traditional ceramic forms can sometimes seem at odds with his writings. Merino's artwork reflects the quintessential American art movement of Jazz. For Merino, it is the imperfections that make something or someone beautiful. Mastery comes from talent honed, skill and practice mixed, so that the skill is engrained. Mastery is not domination of the medium but the opposite...letting go, allowing the process to create. At his best, a swipe of Merino's brush is like a breath of Louis Armstrong pushed through a trumpet: spontaneous, immediate and unbridled. The result is a shadow of the sublime."

It demonstrated that industry will always be the winner when it comes to productivity, efficiency, and engineering. Visiting these factories made it clear that I am making work for completely different reasons. I tried to articulate this for a long time before realizing Yanagi, in The Unknown Craftsman, had thoroughly covered the topic, in a way that helped me see pottery as relevant, instead of an anachronism. The question “why make pots today?” became an issue to explore, and still remains an important issue to me today. In contrast to industrial dinnerware, I was once able to handle a Sultanabad bowl from the thirteenth century. The piece was broken, exposing the cross section. I was surprised to see the clay body looked like a mixture of sand and gravel. People had created something beautiful out of clay I would have considered unusable. It showed me that I may be inefficient compared to a machine, but I am capable of many other things. Individuals, unlike factories, can indulge in developing creative, eccentric ideas. Pottery has a passive, practical role, but at the same time it is decorative and full of content and associations. This creates a very interesting contradiction. I have always loved exploring historical pottery, architectural ornament, ceramic materials, and processes. Attempting to make sense of the jumble of ideas and influences in my head and applying them to objects as commonplace as pottery is what keeps me motivated in my studio."

This abstract nature of reality is not really about doing or what has been done and becomes artifact, but what is. Ultimately it is a connectedness that plays the role of \"life spark\", always unspent, continuously potent, before and after every moment. It is the seed of imagination. Making art opens the door to this area. Opening that door is my reason for creating anything. Attempting that means I have first been there, consciously or unconsciously. One comes to the process with a certain capacity for experience. Being curious about the world involves, essentially, an investigation into the nature of the self and the structure of what one is made of: energy, pattern, intelligence and connection to origin. Curiosity is a gift that is fulfilled through the ability to listen. Listening to the quietest messages focuses the attention at the moment a \"thing\" is manifested. That involves timing. Timing is rhythm and without it we are lost. Utilizing time is dancing with time and not being consumed by it. The perfection of that moment can yield the emergence of a new reality. There is sheer joy in the authenticity of it. Owning more of that connectedness throughout the process of creating is reason enough to continue."

Aoki has become one of the leaders of a new generation of ceramicists, having helped establish Ikeyan, a group of young Japanese potters that he now oversees. More recently, he has expanded his cultural reach to the international community. Recruiting, via Facebook, interns to work in his studio, he has taken to furnishing a handful of young Italians and Indonesians with the skills he taught himself.

The forms are reminiscent of both Koryo dynasty and Song dynasty, examples he observed as a resident artist in China in 2002. He states, ”My work is an amalgamated map of the world I reflect upon. Producing pottery is a kind of play; a regenerative act ripe with reverence, revealing the human hands enduring connection to creativity. It guides us through stories of our past remaining as a cultural signifier to help us locate where we once were and where we are going.\""

I often start with a loose image of what I want to create, but I’ve learned to allow space for freedom to respond to materials and form during the production of the work. I use human forms, flora and fauna because these three motifs allow me a direct way to illustrate certain emotions. I use clay as my medium because it offers an immediate way to work with form, volume and surface."

Porcelain has long been her preferred medium as she is drawn to its essential qualities of translucency, luminosity, and strength. She forms each piece by hand on a potter's wheel and later fires it to 2400° F in a kiln. A balance of clean lines, curves, and volume draw emphasis to the form of each piece. Some are unadorned while others are embellished with patterns that are drawn and carved freehand into the surface of the clay, pierced through the clay, or applied with slip. The quiet beauty of each piece is enhanced with a soft translucent glaze, revealing subtle details. Autumn’s most recent body of work is largely influenced by the combination of her many inspirations; the beauty of her surroundings in mid-coast Maine, her travels and experiences as an exchange artist in Morocco, and her personal research as a curious historian of ceramic objects from many cultures. Autumn Cipala holds a BFA from the New York State College of Ceramics at Alfred University, and an MFA from University of Nebraska – Lincoln. She exhibits her work nationally and internationally."

I make objects for daily use in domestic settings, informed by my belief that interesting and beautiful functional objects help to transform otherwise routine activities into meaningful life-affirming moments. Although I exhibit my work in galleries, the gallery is an intermediary space between my studio and the home. Utilitarian pots are to be touched, held, filled, emptied, cleaned, and shared. These attributes define and direct my practice. I hope to enhance our breaks in the day—modest endeavors such as afternoon coffee, conversation, and sharing in drink with friends. Yet my pottery also encourages all-too-rare moments of reflection and celebration. As themes and styles emerge and fall away, or slowly evolve over many years, one seemingly Sisyphean goal remains central to my work: to make pots that feel timeless. I want to make work that appears intimately aware of ceramic history, without directly reflecting it.I avoid both distinct historical references and passing trends. While I am guided by canons of proportion, such as the golden ratio, I seek a balance between tension and resolve. Through this exploration of tension, characteristics emerge that range from austere to quirky, from monumental to diminutive. In any case, I am forever seeking the sublime. My approach to making is driven by the gestalt principle. I am inspired by historical ceramic objects for serving food and drink, contemporary industrial design, the dignity of craft, the act of teaching, the human experience of shared meals, and the concept of morning coffee."

He has mastered the use of image transfer, and invented a technique he dubbed \"volumetric image transfer\" where he transfers screen printed pattern and imagery onto the surfaces of his pots while they are still wet and being thrown on the wheel, requiring him to shape the vessels from the inside only, so as to not disturb the pattern. His body of work has brought great acclaim, not the least of which was when he was awarded the distinguished honor of Ceramic Artist of the Year (2014) by Ceramics Monthly Magazine."

I use ceramics, an integration of form and surface in space, to pose questions about placement, movement and perception. I make poems for the eye and the hand. Composite arrangements of forms support fired layers of color. Most of my works have remained intimate in scale, and nod to the tactile and visual potential of clay surfaces. My ceramic work continues to display geometries influenced by organic possibilities natural to ceramics. Surfaces on sculptures and utilitarian pieces began as line drawings in wet thrown porcelain during the 1970’s. Color and value further differentiate real and implied space. Surface patterns, visual trails left by repetitive hand motions, lead the eye over shadows and enveloped spaces."

Woodman has traveled extensively, finding inspiration in cultures around the world. Artist and writer Jeff Perrone has described Woodman’s remarkable ability to draw on many sources: \"As a body of work, her ‘style’ is an ever-changing constellation of ceramic styles…This ceramic eclecticism is an implicit critique of modernist “purity”, the leveling of variety and difference. But Woodman’s eclecticism, her pluralism is not a scrambling or confusion of systems. It is the selection of what is best from various styles; it requires more care, more orderliness to be an eclectic than to apply a single standard or adhere to a single model.\" Betty Woodman lives and works in New York City and Antella, Italy. Her work has been shown around the world in exhibitions in France, Italy, Holland and Japan. The Metropolitan Museum, New York will present a retrospective of Woodman’s work in June 2006."

Part of her inspiration drives from this, and the rest from decorative objects crafted by silversmiths and French porcelain of 18th-century. Her use of pattern is influenced by wallpaper and textiles. Alyssa uses slip-cast midrange clay and vinyl resist for the patterns.

Depending on the requirements of the project, I transform this drawing into a physical object by combining digital technology, such as CNC milling, laser cutting and 3D printing with analoge hand-forming skills. The resulting object is often used to create molds for casting clay and other materials. I am constantly trying to discover new ways to utilize CNC and 3D fabrication technology in my work and to share this knowledge with my students. Since graduate school, I have spent my time designing and building custom furniture commissions and continuing my research with digital fabrication tools. This research encopasses mastering more complex CNC milling operations using RhinoCAM, for 3 and 4 axis milling with the use of a rotary table attachment. I have  also spent considerable time embedding this information into my course content at LSU. This includes written tutorials on these topics which are available to my students here on my website."

Over the last 27 years, 24 apprentices from the US and 3 European countries have trained and worked in that studio. Today, many of these apprentices are involved in the  field of contemporary ceramics becoming part of the group I refer to as  the “New Functionalists”; artists academically trained in Fine Art focusing on utilitarian ceramics as their art form. A career long  passion for locally prospected and harvested ceramic materials led me  to work with Potters for Peace in setting up a ceramics studio in a  Burmese Refugee camp in 2002, and again in 2004 to train the refugees in making ceramic water filters. Inspired by teaching in the camp, I  returned to school at age 50 to complete my Masters degree and began  teaching ceramics at the college level in 2007. Currently, I head  the Ceramics Department at Mendocino College in Ukiah CA and have a  studio practice making utilitarian ceramics and sculpture in Elk CA. “I  am intrigued by the relationship of architecture and the human figure,  that place where the figure finds form in architecture and architecture finds form in figuration.

Despite his weighty heritage, Kondo did not start working in ceramics until 1986. His early ceramics followed a more traditional path, but he soon established his own independent artistic identity creating dynamic modern work, using simple slabbed forms and experimenting with other media such as metals and cast glass. His experiments with metals resulted in the creation of his unique “silver mist” glaze, for which he is now well known. Kondo draws inspiration from the natural world, with water being a central theme. His work took on another dimension after the disaster of 3/11 when he created a series of meditative figures, the Reduction series, to call attention to the causes and consequences of the events in the Tohoku area for all of Japan."

I build pieces from slabs and extruded pieces of clay, at times combining both techniques. When working with slabs of clay, I frequently make paper patterns to work out design problems. The model is then taken apart and used to cut out pieces from clay slabs. Extruded pieces of clay are cut apart and reassembled, with small slabs used to close the ends. This process is akin to playing with legos. The more pieces there are to play with, the more ideas there are to explore. Sometimes, finished pieces consist of separate parts that can be arranged in different ways, as whims dictate. Firing is done in an electric kiln to cone five. Some pieces get a layer of white slip before bisque firing. After the first firing, a copper wash is applied followed by another layer of slip. Underglaze pencil and black mason stain are used to accent the edges. Color is added in the form of stains, glaze, or colored slip, but used sparingly. Images also come and go in my work, using photos I've taken and transferred to clay using different techniques."

She fell in love with the intimate nature of utilitarian ceramics and how these pieces are a part of our everyday experience, from plates arranged on a table to how a cup touches your lips. Dara is a full time studio artist based in Salt Lake City, UT. She received a BFA from Virginia Tech and an MFA from Montana State University. In 2005, she was an Artist in Residence at the Archie Bray Foundation in Helena, Montana. After graduate school she moved to Washington and was an Adjunct Professor at Clark College in Vancouver, WA and at Oregon College of Art and Craft in Portland, OR. While in Oregon she was commissioned by Marriott to create 70 figurative sculptures for their Courtyard by Marriott Portland City Center hotel. Most recently, Dara’s life has taken her to Salt Lake City, UT where she worked for 3 years as a product designer, a design team leader, and traveled to China to work with factories on model design and production. Dara’s designs are an exploration of form and surface. Her work is first made by sculpting a model of each design then casting it in plaster. Next, the molds are cast with porcelain slip. Once removed from the mold each piece is hand carved with a pattern. These pieces are finished with luscious glazes over the subtle textures that add a tactile experience to the work."

Work almost always develops in a series, where a conversation can unfold from piece to piece. Both my Pinto Pottery artist series and Jamaica Clay functional pottery benefit from returning to familiar forms and interpreting them anew. My studio sits by the Martha Brae River, surrounded by think stands of bamboo and partially restored 17th century buildings that house my studio, gallery and other buildings and dwellings that make up the Good Hope Estate.  Coming to the studio allows you to see my latest work in sculpture as well as functional pieces. The trip to Trelawny is a treat. We like to think that our part of the island has country hospitality figured out."

The limited color palette of clay slips and glazes is selected through the need to simplify. My artistic vocabulary is nourished by a diverse range of historic and contemporary art and ceramics sources.  These many influences and interests are assimilated with my personal artistic perspective and inclinations.  The goal is to create unique, well-conceived individual ceramic objects.  The ideal is to create ceramic works with qualities that will enrich the viewer’s life. At its most basic, I make work that “feels right” to me at a given moment.  It is a quest that is continuously motivating, sustaining and one that is an ongoing challenge after many years working in clay. I use a variety of methods (including wheel throwing, altering, and press molding) to create the forms. My decoration currently uses contrasting surfaces of glaze, slip, and clay to create hard-edge designs.  The pots are then fired in a salt kiln.  This firing method, coupled with atmospheric sensitive glazes, produces pots with a rich range of color and surface variation."

The pottery is then high fired in a salt kiln to approximately 2300 degrees. As the wax burns off in the kiln, salt is introduced into the kiln through ‘spy holes’, reacting with the silica in the clay and causing the distinctive “salt-fired” sheen to appear on the surface of the pot."

Pottery allows me to form ideas about the content of an object and still explore material and surface. Keeping the forms simple, my work is about material, line and space."

I have willingness to look beyond our borders and traditions for answers, ideas, and stimulation. By broadening the conversation artistically, socially, politically, and geographically, I will be a part of the movement to train the new generation of artists who are reacting to this post digital time. I am focused on forming a new curriculum with new ideas and models for the development of design, not only to attain my own artistic goals, but also to pass along these findings to my peers, mentors, and students in the United States and abroad. My future goals include developing a ceramic design collective where I will be the principle designer, continuing on my quest for a design-oriented ceramic aesthetic, and becoming a full-time professor at the university level so that I may continue to push the limitations in the fields of ceramics, design, art and craft."

To my mind, the best pots are both understated and lively, and seem both new and old at the same time.  They make themselves useful. The majority of my pieces are woodfired in a kiln I designed and built with my own hands in 2001.  A new larger wood kiln is in the planning stages now. The wood-fired work is complemented by Tiny Plate World Headquarters, my wheel-thrown and hand-painted tiny plates. In the early days of the pandemic (May 2020) I embarked on a research project of New Mexico wild clays.  This research is ongoing and has taken an increasingly prominent role in my practice."

While still technically utilitarian in form, these pieces that visually reflect my personal relationship with the world outside, work best in groups and thereby conceptually confuse the idea of utility. While each mug can function by itself in a traditional way, the group must be united to reveal the complete visual reflection of my surroundings. Each platter series contains segments of a single snapshot of places that I have traveled to frequently over my lifetime. Instead of the iconic, instantly readable tourist photo, these images represent intimate and personal records of the passage of time in a familiar place. In addition, they move away from the idea of utility by paying homage to the ceramic chargers of Renaissance Italy that acted as a canvas to be hung and appreciated visually, rather than filled with spaghetti."

They shape each pot by hand, and freehand decorate in a variety of styles and designs created by Miranda Thomas. Miranda a renowned potter based in Vermont was born in New York, raised in Italy, Australia, and England. Her style is globally informed. She was introduced to pottery at the age of 16 and received a B.A. in Ceramics in England. She trained with the great master potters Michael Cardew CBE and Alan Caiger-Smith OBE. Miranda married the Irish furniture maker Charles Shackleton. Together they created their combined workshops and company ShackletonThomas. With their talented highly skilled team of potters, they share a passion for handwork. It is this handwork they believe gives each piece character, soul, and life. Her pottery is collected in thousands of homes, and she has had the honor of designing and making many diplomatic gifts for both the Clinton and Obama administrations and for The United Nations Associations. These include gifts and awards from former President Barack Obama, and UN Secretary Generals Ban Ki Moon, Kofi Annan, as well as former President Bill Clinton’s gift to Pope John Paul II. Thomas’s designs draw from the English countryside, as well as using symbolism and patterns from ancient Japanese, Middle Eastern, and Aboriginal designs, among other international influences. Thomas is a direct descendant of famed architect Arthur J. Davis, the interior designer for London’s Ritz Hotel, Royal Automobile Club, as well as the White Star ocean liners such as The Queen Mary, and Aquatania. Thomas received a B.A. in Ceramics from the West Surrey College of Art & Design in Farnham, England. After then training with Michael Cardew CBE and Alan Caiger-Smith OBE, she designed and started the pottery for Simon Pearce. Miranda Thomas is married to furniture maker Charles Shackleton, with whom she owns ShackletonThomas. They share a passion for creating high-quality, beautiful objects with simple, everyday uses, and for using handmade techniques to instill their pieces with character, soul, and life."

    "bio": "The pieces I create are visual and sculptural objects. I conceive of each body of work with a particular set of formal goals in mind. The contours and volumes, colors and surfaces of the objects I create compose a dimensional image. Volume is a key element in utilitarian forms as it defines the potential for containment. The visual evidence and the physical quality of this volume is important to the way my work communicates formally, whether the volume is expansive and taut or soft and weighted. I think of the outlines and edges of the work as drawn lines. I choose and manipulate the softness, weight and speed of these lines. Edges and lines either define or interact with the volume of the forms. Surfaces, whether they are visually complex, or minimal, are chosen in part based on how they respond to and enhance form and line. I observe and enhance the visual and physical relationships between two or more forms when they meet in a pair or grouping.      Utility is often a primary concern. The audience’s real or implied interaction with my work provides not only its context, but also much of its content. The immediate context of this work is of course, the home. The larger context of the work lies within the long history of the decorative arts and the field of craft. The kind of visual and physical interaction we have with domestic objects, and our attention to and understanding of these objects is quite different than what occurs in a museum or gallery. I craft my work paying studied attention to the weight and texture of each piece. I anticipate that the work will be held, carried, and poured from; lids will be lifted and replaced. Details are important. My more elaborate forms are designed to require care and attention when used, the simpler ware is designed for a less conscious interaction."

In 1981 he was named one of the top twelve world’s greatest living potters by Ceramics Monthly readers. Reitz earned his MFA at Alfred University in 1962, where he began experimenting with salt-glazing, a technique largely neglected by the post-World War II ceramic studio movement.  Readily embracing this firing technique, Reitz quickly realized that it allowed the clay to keep its natural character, and its malleability did not obscure the creator’s hand.  In a decade’s time, he was dubbed “Mr. Salt” by his peers. He spent many years as an educator as well as a potter; he taught at the University of Wisconsin-Madison for more than 25 years before retiring as a professor emeritus in 1988. His extensive body of work is represented in over 50 distinguished public and private collections. Don Reitz lived and worked in Clarkdale, Arizona. He claimed that he would have been a poet but for dyslexia and his inability to process language. This redirected him toward visual art where he found his voice in clay. Reitz’s art is his legacy, and through constant reinvention and originality, he extended the definition and potential of the ceramic arts."

There is something magical about this technique that seems to bring each piece to life towards the end of that process. The final lines in my carved pieces are enhanced by the use of celadon glazes that help define the design. Moving to Nevada has influenced my drawing but I still like doing other images.

    "bio": "My artwork is a reflection of how I interpret my physical and cultural surroundings through the medium of clay. Foremost in this search is a personal need to express ideas through the creation of objects which have been created by my own hands. Through the transfiguration of the seemingly known object, I challenge viewers' perceptions of what they are familiar with by creating a new reality. This interaction, and my desire to create unique objects, ultimately led to a conceptual approach to what I make out of clay.     People have been making objects out of clay for thousands of years, and it is within this great tradition that I create objects, knowing they are somehow part of an evolution. Paradoxically, I will have created a series of objects that have never been seen or created before in ceramic history. It is this profound idea that causes me to conscientiously view my sculptures as a part of history, while also striving to create work that is inherently about the present world and my own place within it.      My process of creation is driven by an obsession to communicate through visual objects; an obsession that derives from early childhood experiences, and later by my travels and intellectual interests. This obsession to create has inspired me to transform objects from the everyday world into a world of my own \"creation\" that speaks of ideas on visual beauty as a concept, function versus non-function, desire, playfulness, the abstracted human form, and sublime mystery.     This transformation of the known world results in quasi-organic sculptures that also relate to my background growing up in the industrial northeast, and having spent time on boats and renovating houses, to name a few sources. Physically, the objects often reference buoys, bobbers, boat fenders, toys, and industrial implements. These \"sublime\" objects, with their utilitarian implied aesthetic, are transformed into playful industrial/ organic objects with a surreal hybrid edge. Within this realm, a subtle reference to the human figure has crept into the work, adding a sensual anthropomorphic dimension to the sculptures.     Ultimately I can rationalize much of what I create, but there will always be an element to the work which is difficult to explain or categorize. One of my teachers called this realm \"tolerance of the unknown\". In the creation of these objects, it is my hope that I will come up with a sculpture that will intrigue the viewer in some unique way and enable them to walk away with a sense of intellectual curiosity and awe."

And how the relationship between function and ornament shift throughout the course of a day/week/year.

She has been a Resident Artist at The Clay Studio of Missoula, and selected as an Emerging Artist by Ceramics Monthly magazine. “I translate my daily landscape into playful abstract drawings that wrap around the surface of my ceramic pots. My drawings are full of scribbles and smudges, which can be a form of spontaneous expression or a means to hide something that wasn’t good enough. When I am making pottery, the forms I create are soft and smooth, offering a sense of gentleness to the user. Some areas of my pots receive glaze, providing protection, while other spaces are left raw, exposed, and vulnerable. My pots are intended for use. A space exists between people and pottery where quiet exchange can happen. Handmade pots hold nourishment for the spirit and body and, in return, are held close by those that own and use them."

My hope is that function, form, and the surface of my pots will bring the user respite. Clay presents the opportunity of constant problem solving, and combines my interests in aesthetic research and manual labor."

    "bio": "Fine bone china and porcelain are frequently associated with treasured heirlooms that are passed down between generations.  My association with porcelain stems from early childhood summer trips to visit my grandmother in Northern Ireland, where she would take me to local china shops to buy small porcelain souvenirs.  As I pursued my ceramic education, and started working with porcelain, these memories came to the forefront to influence both my techniques and directions. My current work combines elements of manufactured porcelain and Japanese pottery, particularly Shigaraki stoneware. Fine porcelain is highly processed and purified, mass-produced, and fired in a controlled manner using saggars, effectively removing any evidence of an individual artist.   In contrast, Shigaraki ware is typically handmade stoneware with feldspar inclusions fired in an anagama kiln, the only decoration coming from the randomness of wood ash.  The connection between the potter’s touch and the fire’s effect on the final piece is retained. In my work, feldspar inclusions are added to porcelain and the resulting surfaces are achieved through a combination of an unpredictable atmospheric gas firing and reliable electric firing. The conflict is further explored by incorporating open-stock decals and metallic lusters, which have often been overlooked by modern studio potters as feminine hobby materials.  I am interested in the conflict created by kitsch images on handmade objects, and in challenging the aesthetics and values presented when using such materials unconventionally. The resulting works illustrate the contrasts in aesthetics, forms, traditions, and function found between Japanese pottery and European fine porcelain. Through the application of underglazes, overglazes and decals, the textures are further enriched to give a more visceral surface not often associated with porcelain."

My ceramic education started under the wing of a master ceramist at an experimental studio in Mexico City. I then continued hands on learning in Southern California in three different studios. My ceramic education was augmented by traveling to China and Mexico to learn about traditional clay work and techniques. An apprenticeship at Studio Pieter Stockmans in Genk, Belgium, had a great impact on my work, and later directed me to be an Artist in Residence at the International Ceramics Studio in Kecskemet, Hungary. After my time in Europe, I embraced the industrial process of slip casting with all its personality and difficulties within my professional work. Functionality, ergonomics, repetition, nature and the intrinsic characteristics of the material bring to life my porcelain work. Contrast of varied color shades, their softness and sharp edges along with linear abstract motifs, result in a dramatic chromatic composition in contrast to the white surface of the porcelain. The character of my current work resides in the exploration of small but significant variations of shape, size and patterns."

Making pots is a deliberate attempt at slowing down, connecting to something deeper, and taking time to appreciate the pleasure of labor. In addition, I value the constraints of working with one material and with a certainty of purpose. This allows me to explore notions of beauty and cultivate a sense of order. My forms focus on creating a space for their intended use as well as acting as a canvas for patterns. I use pattern as a means of exploring the nature of abstraction, representation, and beauty. What is most compelling about the use of pattern is that its meaning can be elastic and fluid, it requires only one small graphic element used in repetition to become something greater that the sum of its parts. Many of the motifs I use are adapted or interpreted from textiles, paintings, and natural geometry. My formal vocabulary is culled from historic and contemporary ceramic art, design, and my own few novel additions. It is within these chosen limitations that I search for a sense of beauty, self-expression, and common experience."

I discovered A Potter’s Book by Bernard Leach, a champion of pottery traditions of East and West. I wanted to be a part of the historical sweep of traditional pottery. Ten years later in Venezuela I began potting full time. Warren MacKenzie was invited by a local potters group to come and teach. MacKenzie had apprenticed with Leach in the 50’s and, beyond becoming a friend, he shared his studio with me and his appreciation of historical pots. From discussion, from living with his collection of great pottery, his library and MacKenzie’s own work I avidly soaked up the spirit of the old pots I admired so much. I do not consciously design my pots with drawings or plans. I set out to make teapots, for example, and the making process generates ideas, each piece responding to the one before. Subtle variations on simple forms often result in dramatic changes in the character and personality of a pot. Small details, accidents, a dent, texture, an accent, a curve of belly, a kink in a handle may all have surprising results. Even when making sets, each piece, like children, will have its own character."

The pots that I respond to all speak of a clear, direct sense of the hand. The hand is celebrated in the work by its maker, whether it is that of a fifteenth-century rural potter or a nineteenth-century court artisan. And it becomes a necessary tool for the user in understanding the relationship of the object to its function, and subsequently, to how that object informs one’s life. Though most of my work only alludes to function, I use the pot context because of its immense possibilities for abstraction. The skin of the clay holds the invisible interior of the vessel. How I manipulate my forms “around” that air, constraining it, enclosing it, or letting it expand and swell, can allow analogy and metaphor to enter into the work."

Referencing the vast history of ceramics I focus on those cultures that place a deep significance on functional objects and at times have elevated a mundane pot to sublime status.  Forms developed from these sources tend toward the understated and the familiar. I typically use unglazed clay fired in a wood-burning kiln as the finish on a piece.  Occasionally an austere glaze may be used to cover the form.  In either case these pots will probably challenge the definition of beauty.  These surface choices help to hold the users attention and perhaps discover something new and unexpected about the pot in particular and the experience of using a functional object. My pots contain ideas lying somewhere between comfortable and uncomfortable, familiar and unfamiliar, ugly and beautiful.  This middle ground has the potential to interact with the individual on levels more closely associated with fine art such as feelings of spirituality or of personal reflection."

Reminiscent of Abstract Expressionism, Dan's use of color and unique glazing methods produce pottery that harmonizes with both the contemporary and the nostalgic. His use of clay is an exploration of form, lending itself to practical, utilitarian pottery. His vibrant glazes are the result of a lifetime of playful experimentation. We After studying ceramics at Alfred University, Dan left New Jersey for the Green Mountains of Vermont where he started D. Lasser Ceramics, his studio and showroom in Londonderry. Since the 1980's, D. Lasser Ceramics has been producing dinnerware, accent pieces, sculptures and garden ceramics for homes and galleries. Dan envisions himself doing this forever- being in the studio as an old man, but still feeling like the child that fell in love with pottery."

    "bio": "As a vessel maker, I have always been attracted to interior volumes, and their power to entice a viewer to touch and explore. I use subtle curves and relaxed lines to create objects for contemplation and use. The acts of conveying sustenance and of personal intimacy are characteristics of functional pottery that interest me, and I convey those ideas into my current work to heighten a sense of intimacy and accessibility. The formal characteristics of my pieces are derived from human bodies, from contemporary tableware, and from the visual ergonomics of food service. I have looked to these sources of inspiration because I want my work to simultaneously reflect notions of expansion and comfortable containment.          I approach the presentation of my work from the daily activities in the home and kitchen. I design my pots so they are activated and completed by the plating of food. With a simplistic sensibility, my work attempts to share the plate with the food, not compete for space. My desire to bring an audience together with food and functional pots led me to coordinate dinner collaborations with chefs and like-minded potters. These events brought me to where I am today, designing objects with sensitivity for the hand made object, from a background in craft unique and vital to the future of studio ceramics."

I aspire to incorporate beauty, simplicity, and harmony within my art, while still expanding ceramic traditions, techniques, and perceptions. In this way, a greater sense of existence is evoked for each new object created. I hope you enjoy the work. Currently, I am channeling the same creative energies I use as an artist into my position as Gallery Director at the Living Arts and Science Center.

Julie is a 2007 Fellowship Recipient from the New York Foundation for the Arts. She is also a member of Handwork,  Ithaca's Cooperative Craft Store. The search to find a balance between the decorated surface and the pot’s form is a puzzle, with an elusive solution, that sustains my interest. I’m prompted to design the surface spontaneously; to map my experiences and draw from my inspirations. My work forms a bridge between two-dimensional media and the sculptural aspects of pots. An etched line, a calligraphic brushstroke and the movement and pattern of a written language influence the surface. Growth and motion are represented by universal images of birds and plants. I like the idea that a unique intimacy can be intrinsically produced and remain in a potentially ordinary object. Through creating pots, I’m able to be a part of this relationship by connecting with another's experience and imagination."

I use the sgrafitto carving technique which was developed in the eastern Mediterranean in the 4th century.  The images on their pots represented aspects of their everyday experiences.  This idea of using scenes and icons from daily life has always been an integral part of my work.  I use an English porcelain clay and to complete my pots I fire them in a salt kiln, a firing method developed in Germany in the 16th century.  I am also influenced by Asian, English, Islamic and French pottery from different periods.  I strive to encompass many ceramic traditions from around the world and from different parts of history in the pots I make.  Using the reductive sgrafitto carving method enables me to add movement to the images on the surface of my pots.  To further amplify this notion of lively animation I use the salt glaze firing method to activate the surface of my pots.  This firing style promotes subtle color variations in the clay and applied glazes while also glazing the  carved areas of my pots.  The fire completes my process making each piece distinctive."

    "bio": "Mangus uses a variety of clay bodies but prefers those that are locally available. He also uses a number of forming methods, among them throwing, pinching and coiling and what he calls the “coil and throw” which involves joining a coil to a base and then throwing it, repeating the process until the piece is the size he wants. In addition he often uses press molds, many of which incorporate the images he likes to use in the mold itself. Imagery is very important to Mangus and the deep, multi-layered carvings on his pieces carry reminders of ancient pottery. Finishes range from none at all to thin glazes to thick lusters. Some of the pieces are fired in a wood-fired kiln built into the side of a hill on his parents’ farm in Pennsylvania. Mangus controls the results he is looking for by varying the length of the firing and the position of the ware in the kiln. He also fires in salt, gas, and electric kilns. His fascination with all things clay stems from his sheer love of the medium. “The bottom line is pottery. I love finished pottery; seeing ware boards full. I love working on the wheel; I am pretty much a mud and water man. Firing is interesting and I have made the range – wood, salt, electric, gas – every temperature I could come up with. But it is the finished object that holds the greatest weight.” Mangus works fast and with great energy and his approach is reflected in his pieces. His finished pieces are rough, the images apparently randomly applied, but in fact the entire process is a conscious one. “I want my pots to not be something that sits back but to reach out and grab you,” Mangus says, and sees his work as being about “movement and leaving an object frozen in motion.”3 The images, too, are crudely drawn, but consciously so, raw and rough like the raw and rough creatures – both human and non-human – that they represent. Fired in the wood kiln they take on a timeless appearance further emphasizing the universal connection of all things, the presence of the past in the here and now. “For every mark that I’ve laid down, I’ve met all those people, and I think about the grocery store and the disco. Then ash flies through the kiln and lands on the pot and makes it look a million years old, even though it’s this highly contemporary thing sitting there on the table staring back at you.”4 Through his work Mangus reflects on the human condition, the cycle of life and death and the acceptance of mortality - the knowledge of the tragedy of existence tempered by the eternal link between everything that has been and everything that is. Mangus has received a number of awards for his work. Among them are a National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship, a Pennsylvania Council on the Arts Fellowship, Ohio Arts Council Fellowships (multiple), McKnight Fellowship Residency at the Northern Clay Center, and National Council on the Education of Ceramics Art International Residency Award. He has been a visiting artist and given many workshops both nationally and internationally, and his work is included in collections worldwide."

From the lush swamps of Baton Rouge to the high peaks of the Blue Ridge Mountains, my porcelain forms and surface treatments are informed by the abundance and beauty of my surroundings. An equal partner in my creative interest is found amidst 18th and 19th Century decorative arts, particularly Rococo silver and Sèvres porcelain, where exaggerated or elongated components speak to my natural inclination toward balance and design. My imagination comes to life at the confluence of this historical foundation and my contemporary observations, resulting in elegant, whimsical, visually appealing, functional ceramics. While my work is always changing, there are certain features my imagination returns to again and again: undulating lobes, fluid lines, smooth ridges, bulbous features, and precise, decorative finishing touches on feet, handles, lips, or spouts. I’m drawn toward the suggestion of excess where glazes might pool or a thrown form might be altered beyond expectation; but I’m likewise wedded to utilitarian forms that flawlessly function and inspire a moment of delight or enjoyment each time the cup is lifted, the pitcher poured, the plate served, the creamer chilled."

The first ceramics were simple vessels, but Pankhurst’s contemporary ceramics have developed far beyond the concept of vessels and now show a tremendous diversity.      “My pottery is about the exploration of form and shape in the context of its functionality,” states Pankhurst. “I am exploring the combination of hand built elements and textures with wheel thrown forms some of which are altered.”      Pankhurst’s art clearly elicit the originality and creative spirit of contemporary ceramic art. Yet the originality comes from the love of another craft."

It was a transformational experience. I studied with a cohort of talented and committed undergraduate students at the University until 1971.  In the summer of 1973 I set up a pottery studio in a rural area outside of Houston, MN and produced work in that studio until 1989.  In 1985 I joined the Department of Art at the University of Minnesota as a faculty member. I served as the chair of the department from 1998 to 2004 and as Associate Dean in CLA from 2005-2008. Nearly all of my early work was functional, wheel thrown and \"once fired\" in a wood and oil fired kiln. Since 1992 I have worked exclusively in earthenware.  Today, my work is hand built from forms cut from slabs using two-dimensional paper patterns.  The process owes much to the traditions of pattern making found in sewing and sheet metal work.  I think about and use geometry while making these pieces.  However, it is casual, intuitive and not derived from serious math."

Not one for subtleties, I tend to pack as much visual information together to create an abstract, often confusing narrative. A piece usually springs from a general theme. I want to lead the viewer in a general direction, but not so specific that everyone will read it the same way. My ideas can come from anywhere; personal experiences, good or bad…sometimes experiences I wish I’d have. I tend to listen to the radio a lot while I work, and quite often inspired by the stories I hear throughout the day.    I use a color pallet that leans towards bright happy colors, contradicting the often dark and sinister subject matter of the imagery."

In the mid-70s he found himself in San Clemente, California looking for any kind of unskilled work — going into surf shops and t-shirt shops and asking “I’m looking for work are you hiring?” A few days into job hunting he remembers standing outside a low green cinder block building and telling himself  ‘one more try today and you can go home.’ He went inside, made the same inquiry, and 2 days later was hired to run something called a pug mill (a machine that makes clay). He had been working at this small ceramic supply business for 4 months, having no idea what people did with the clay, when one Saturday he went to a nursery. Outside the nursery, as part of a promotion, there was a fellow throwing planters on a potters wheel. He was amazed. At work he found an old potters wheel buried under tons of debris and began staying after hours trying to figure out how to do what he saw the fellow at the nursery do. Nick has been a full time studio potter in Penland, NC since the mid-1980s. He received a B.A.  in History from the University of Dayton, Ohio in 1971 and a MFA from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, La, in 1986. He has taught workshops throughout the United States and abroad. He has been widely reviewed and exhibited and is represented in public and private collections."

The practice and skill development from making pots supports more accuracy when assessing the details of forms – be they \"simple\" cup or trompe L'oeil sculpture. The careful consideration of balance, volume, profile, skin, tension, rhythms of light and shadow, scrutinized in the sculptural work hones these same sensibilities of the potter. We both make sculpture. Some of it holds soup or conveys coffee to the lips, and these are no less engendered of aesthetic concerns. Ceramic sculpture may function to convey a complex narrative, political point of view, or some social agenda. A sculpture may help to inform you about your political leaders robbing you, and a bowl may help you eat while you weep. Though both forms of work develop from training, planning and intuition, the \"multiples\" nature of pot making allows for a flow of intuition through a series of objects. Training and intuition with sculptural work evolves from a series as well but it is centered in sorting or analysis within the object (sculpture)."

For a couple of years after we established our first studio, we made pretty traditional wheel-turned stoneware and porcelain; we never dreamed when we first experimented with coloring the clay rather than using colored glazes that it would turn into our life's work. The use of the human figure and the stylized animal motif has been a recurrent theme in art, especially in pottery making, for thousands of years. We are lucky enough to live in a time and place in which we can see images of this long tradition almost instantaneously, either in person, in books, or over the Internet.  We are inspired by the cave paintings of Lascaux and Altamira, by petroglyphs from the desert southwest, the Anasazi culture and the Tassili region of southern Algeria, and by pictographs from Zimbabwe and South Africa, not to mention the use of figures in Grecian and Mayan pottery.bWe live on a mountaintop in the middle of an old Ozark farm, so we see critters all the time: deer, turkeys, snakes, turtles, lizards, fish. It is interesting to look for the essence of their animal nature, and to give our own interpretations to these things that have inspired artists throughout the ages.Our work is an ongoing inquiry into the very nature of our existence, using a common material in an uncommon way. We are constantly striving to create work that resonates with a connection to the natural world and to humanity's place in it."

I have never felt the need to dismiss or disregard the concept of function because it was something less than art. I have never found making useful pieces confining or restrictive. In fact, I find that the opposite seems true. The longer I stay involved, the more alternatives and possibilities there are that seem to present themselves. Along with the functional aspects of the piece, I strive to have the end product reflect my own sensitivity and awareness to the material itself and its traditions. The pieces that I’m most pleased with are those that come closest to best integrating the form and surface, the spontaneity and fluidity of the clay along with the object’s use."

Without the luxury of choice, the fires of August 2020 which took away my home and studio forced another reinvention. This has brought me full circle to my earliest passions in Ceramics: high fire porcelain, Celadon and Shino Glazes. Our ceramics collection which I believed would endure long beyond my lifetime was reduced almost completely to shards. Thicker pieces with high percentages of fireclay and porcelain had a higher survival rate through this event, and the few forms that survived will inform my work for the next few years. The fires threw down the gauntlet of loss, and I stepped back into the studio a fundamentally different man than the artist who lived in me before the fires. I’m working with familiar forms and processes, but delving deeply into the flow state of creation and the physical weight of forms."

He attended Rhode Island School of Design on a fellowship for one year returning to MN in 1972 to start a pottery in rural central MN. Early American and Asian pottery primarily influenced his work at this time. Most of the work was high-fired salt glazed stoneware and some Raku, which was a carry over from graduate work in Rhode Island. He also worked in a local public school system as an “Artist in Schools”, which was a NEA program across the U.S. during a previously more enlightened time in America. While the kilns and the firing methods varied over time, elemental aspects of the pots remain to this day. A strong sense of form has always been an important fundamental component to Wayne’s work. The forms have evolved from the earlier Asian pottery forms to gradually include more architectural references and the gradual addition of pattern on surfaces. The architectural forms evolved to more figurative sculptures. Today the work ranges from the more utilitarian pottery forms to the sculptural figures and most of the work employs patterned surfaces with a more colorful palette."

Though their influence is felt, Simon's work is unique; every pot emerges with an integrity and attitude all its own. He received his B.F.A. from the University of Minnesota and M.F.A. from the University of Georgia. In 2011, Michael Simon had a major exhibition at The Northern Clay Center entitled Michael Simon: A Life in Pots featuring 30 years of his pottery. In 2013, he exhibited at the Georgia Museum of Art and showcased his best pots from the past several decades. The exhibition was called Pick of the Kiln: The Work of Michael Simon. His work can be found in the Los Angeles County Museum, the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, and is in The Rodger Corsaw Collection of Ceramic Art at Alfred University."

Since 1976, Pipestone has been dedicated to bringing a sense of history and uniquely American style to your home dining experience. The company was founded as Nostalgia Station, Ltd. and is currently doing business as Pipestone. Originally the official gift shop of the B&O Railroad Museum in Baltimore, MD. and serving eight years in that capacity, we carried all kinds of railroad memorabilia. We found, however, that we had a real appreciation for the dining car china that made riding the rails such a luxurious experience in America's past.

It was also up to us to provide our own toys and entertainment, making us quite resourceful. Nature was an integral part of our life. This developed within me a more quiet and reserved personality with a keen observation to detail. My first exposure to the actual shaping of raw clay was in a shopping mall in Kuala Lumpur, I witnessed a demonstration on the wheel and it planted the seed. I was drawn to the idea of infinite variation, of tapping an eternity of creativity. From that point I paid close attention to the ceramic arts. An opportunity presented itself and I was able to come to the United State to attend school. I received my degree in product design but had the opportunity to take ceramic classes as an elective. After working in hospitality for a few years, I decided to pursue the vision that had formed so strongly as a youth. I set up a small studio and began exploring the possibilities. The essence of my work is to create a visual interest that will trigger an aesthetic response. The vessels articulate a rhythm that appeals to an abstract of universal human emotion. Art is an articulated arrangement of a profound idea. To create is divine, I just rearrange."

Snippets and sections of ornament are removed from a more sensible and functional whole. These carefully considered fragments and layers accumulate organically across the surface of the piece. One might recognize floral motifs, snowflakes, microbes or calligraphy within the ambiguous multi-layered surfaces. Yet a sense of order remains, or re-establishes itself, as these embellishments are coupled with overlapping lines and areas of solid color. My objects connect me to the fleeting present, an instant, with a sense of grounding gravity. Yet simultaneously they feel buoyant, as if they could float away, like time passing. I investigate where these two realms overlap, reflecting a liminal state, like the in-between I often feel in daily life."

The imagery is made from a combination of slips, stains and glazes. I primarily use ash glazes, as its main ingredient comes from the very landscape I am drawing inspiration. The pots are created from stoneware and often altered in the wet stage, then fired in a soda kiln. This firing process not only creates very durable objects, it imbues the work with great variation and depth, creating a natural and mysterious surface of a warm and earthy palette.

She makes work in the form of the utilitarian pot but is inspired by and grounded in conceptual, historical and theoretical approaches to ornament, form, use and making. Through the medium of ceramics (and with special attention to specific pattern, ornament, and form) I  am currently exploring the politics of European and American dinnerware and tracing international developments in this medium from Presidential china back to the reigns of French kings Louis XV and Louis XVI. By extrapolating patterns off of china patterns Rozene creates a new visual language that speaks to not only national/international identities but also to the extravagances to which government goes to in order to maintain its identity. Through collaboration with other artists in various media she creates dialogues between culture, use, spending, consumerism, conflict, and excess through pattern."

In 1991 he studied plastic art and ceramics in the United States as a trainee of the Japanese Government Overseas Study Program for Artist. He also made many works and held personal exhibitions at the United States’ Archie Bray Foundation for the Ceramic Arts and universities in various places. The theme for the works is the energy of nature that he felt with his skin in the United States’ majestic natural environment, and he creates dynamic glazed porcelain. Some of his particularly important works of recent years are “Seimei no Ki – Tree of Life,” which was inspired by giant trees in the United States, and “Indomitable,” which was based on large thistles. The “Sound of the Sea” series that was conceived as a result of the massive tsunami in Eastern Japan in 2011 combines the harshness of nature and the way his lives, and he attempted to express unique mental imagery in these works.

She enjoys combining various colors and techniques to achieve depth of surface and interesting results.  The glaze is brushed onto the pots so the surfaces take on a painterly quality.  She sees the surfaces as a combination of Color Field painting converged with Ben Day dots of Pop Art. The surfaces are layered with under glazes, glazes and luster.  Mytty is  interested in the combinations of these materials and their resulting emotive qualities.  In some areas, there are four or five layers of glaze that create a depth of field concealing underlying colors in some areas and revealing in others.  She strives to make beautiful, colorful and happy artwork to function well and bring joy to every day objects.  Each form is one of a kind hand made and uniquely glazed by creating variations on each design.  Mytty has exhibited nationally and is currently living and working out of her studio in Collegeville, Pennsyvania."

    "bio": "I was born and raised in Seattle, WA, and began working with clay in high school in 1968. I went to the University of Washington to work with Robert Sperry, Patti Warashina and Howard Kottler. Receiving my BFA in 1975, I proceeded to set up my studio in the Seattle area. Over the years I’ve taught at the University of Washington and Everett Community College and have given numerous workshops. I currently teach at Shoreline Community College. I have worked predominately in porcelain on the potter’s wheel. My forms are defined by functional simplicity and the white surface of each piece is decorated with abstract brushwork in blues, browns and grays. I also utilize the contrast of the white porcelain surface with a black matte glaze. The development of this glaze has allowed me to employ new forms of decoration on the clay surface, juxtaposing biomorphic poured shapes in contrast to the dense white porcelain. These drips create a graphic tension that is enhanced by orienting the directional flow of the glaze from both rim and foot of the piece. The shape of the pot informs the pouring process creating overlapping patterns which integrate the form, surface, and decoration, unifying the overall design. More recently I have been exploring my interest in science and technology and their impact on society in a series of plates. Impressions of various objects are made in the soft clay, becoming contemporary fossils. The contents of each plate are meant to “serve up” commentaries or provoke observations of the ideas, decisions, and developments that impact our actions and leave an “impression” on our society. My goal is to blend technique and intuition in both form and surface treatment, while working in the vessel format."

Lugo uses porcelain as his medium of choice, illuminating its aristocratic surface with imagery of poverty, inequality, and social and racial injustice. Lugo’s works are multicultural mash-ups, traditional European and Asian porcelain forms and techniques reimagined with a 21st-century street sensibility. Their hand-painted surfaces feature classic decorative patterns and motifs combined with elements of modern urban graffiti and portraits of individuals whose faces are historically absent on this type of luxury item - people like Sojourner Truth, Dr. Cornel West, and The Notorious BIG, as well as Lugo’s family members and, very often, himself. Lugo holds a BFA from the Kansas City Art Institute and an MFA from Penn State. His work has been featured in exhibitions at the Houston Center for Contemporary Craft, the Clay Studio in Philadelphia, and the Museum of Arts and Design in New York, among others. Lugo is the recipient of numerous awards, most recently including a 2019 Pew Fellowship, a Cynthia Hazen Polsky and Leon Polsky Rome Prize, and a US Artist Award. His work is found in the permanent collections of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Philadelphia Museum of Art, The High Museum of Art, the Museum of Fine Arts Boston, Brooklyn Museum, Walters Museum, and more.

The muted color palate gives the work an unimposing quality, paired with clean lines and the contrast of glazed and unglazed surfaces the work has a sharp quality to hold the viewers attention. Function brings the viewer in contact with the illustrations giving them a chance to investigate the form, surface, and drawings.

The direct touch creates a visual tempo inherent to the building process. Throughout my forty-some years of working with clay, I have tended to work intuitively, encouraging a great deal of collaboration with the clay. Why earthenware? The physicality of earthenware clay in nature: eroding and tumbling, washing and settling with organic matter appeals to me. Earthenware is the common clay- its ubiquitous nature means that it is nearly always nearby or underfoot. My first studio pursuit was in painting, and I continue to be informed by both contemporary and historical paintings. I approach the surface of the pot as a painter, using abstract geometric structure to map the geography of the pot, enlivening it with painterly brushing of colored slips and glazes. The glazes are playful, saturated, and luminous. Though densely layered, the resulting surfaces reveal the warmth of the red clay beneath, and patterns often punctuate surface activity. Such diverse works as the lush paintings of recent contemporary painter Thomas Nozkowski, and the current and historical quilts of Gee’s Bend inspire me."

Through the labor-intensive act of making, I establish a close personal relationship with each piece. I am personally influenced by a nostalgia for my childhood home. Architectural imagery drawn from my photographic collection - inlaid with intense attention to detail directly into the porcelain clay body - prompts display of my work when not in use, as a meaningful addition to any collection. Blurred by the movement of glaze, the imagery is much like a faded memory. I am particularly interested in exploring the human need to maintain collections, as a way to preserve the past and satisfy the longing with which we inhabit the world: driven by a desire to hold onto that which will inevitably be lost. My memories and experiences are carved onto objects intended to be both used and collected: as a way to facilitate new relationships to fill the void left by that which we will never have again."

    "bio": "Noah started working in clay in 1999, spurred by his interest in industrial design. He considered ceramics a first, accessible step towards a broader knowledge of materials and production methods that would ultimately inform his own independent product design business. He steered his education to encompass a variety of experience, including scholastic learning, managing a wholesale production studio, a traditional two-year apprenticeship under a master potter, and operating his own pottery business. Along the way, as he developed a deeper respect for old methods of production, he let go of intentions to mass-produce. Though his work still draws from the Organic Modern movement of design pioneered by figures like Alvar Aalto, Eero Saarinen, and Charles and Ray Eames, his approach is tempered by traditional production methods."

I make functional pots and tiles that are meant to celebrate the day, drawing from everyday scenes and objects for my imagery. Capturing the color and movement of the moment is my aim – like when the flowers in my garden tremble in a slight breeze, and the sun glows through them. I’ve been a potter my entire adult life. I grew up in Minneapolis and in 1986, I received my Bachelor of Fine Arts in glass working from St. Cloud State University. After graduation, I was blowing glass in Colorado, Minnesota and Wisconsin. When I moved to West Virginia, I began to use clay and pit fired it in my yard. I also worked in the Clay Center at the West Virginia University and learned a variety of clay techniques. To further my career, I moved to Carbondale, Illinois and did graduate work at Southern Illinois University – receiving a Master in Fine Arts in Ceramics. In 1996, I moved to Victoria, British Columbia and spent two years making pots, gardening and traveling. In 1998, Duluth became my new home. Today, I teach at local colleges and workshops around the country – and you can find my work at Duluth Pottery, at galleries and at fine art fairs. A few years ago, I opened Duluth Pottery, Tile & Gallery as a place to showcase my artwork and that of other talented artist from our region, and across the country."

I am most directly interested in the utilitarian pottery of the southeastern United States from the 19th and early 20th centuries, and the country pottery of Oribe, Japan. Both styles of pottery were made for the storage and serving of food. Both were fairly simply made with minor decoration and glazing. And both were made in a spirit of directness and respect for the material and the process. I have always loved these pots from different cultures and am really trying to capture some of the freshness and strengths of these two influences. My work is always autobiographical whether I am working figuratively or architecturally, or even when making vessels. It is always about history and/or age, and always tells a story, a personal narrative. I rely on memory, free association, and daily life events as my subject matter. Most recently my children have been a big part of the picture. Prior to that a trip to Crete to study Minoan archeology was my source of inspiration."

    "bio": "My creative interest is to convey structure, tranquility and depth in three-dimensional form. Rich softness of ancient fabrics, implied volume of upholstery, order and composition in architectural elements are all influential to my work. The delicate gauzy backgrounds found in Persian miniature paintings are the primary focus of surface and texture. Leaves, both fresh and fallen, water worn rocks and glass, and blooms and branches are strong sources of inspiration with their blended color fields, worn and waxy surfaces, soft curves and directness of form. These interests are explored and applied to surface with a vibrant yet subdued color pallet, an atmospheric fuming process, and in form through literal and abstract means. Concepts of strength and serenity are translated into objects through an innate approach to form.  Incorporating functional design increases the interaction with the viewer thus allowing for a closer are more intimate interpretation. Focusing on the directness and gesture of the form rather than its specific function keeps me actively connected to what and how the work is communicating. The strongest visual influences in my work today are the poignant portraits of historic nobility found in Persian miniature paintings and Asian floral patterns. Peripheral interests that feed my personal exploration include the growth and uniqueness of flowers grown for domestic, concrete pillars and wooden cooking vessels of the mid 19th and 20th century."

Working with clay is as exciting and terrifying as a roller coaster ride, presenting as many challenges as rewards. To understand this soft malleable material — really just a lump of wet earth — takes time, but with considered handling and measured judgement it can be manipulated into dynamic and expressive form. This transformation goes through many stages as the clay is first shaped, then hardened and dried, before being finally and inexorably altered by the alchemy of firing to a new ceramic form — hard, durable and permanent."

My studio is right on the cliffs here in south Devon, in a very unspoilt area. The light is wonderful and I find a great deal of intense colour throughout the year. I enjoy the changing seasons as each brings it’s own beauty. The sunrises in February are often spectacular; the wild flowers in May and June create great sweeps of colour across the cliffs, the berries and bramble leaves of autumn provide intense focal points. I take a lot of photographs, both slides and prints and often use these as source material from which to draw. The drawing process for me is a way of distilling the essence of what I have seen, looking for whatever it was that touched my button, in order that I might use it to touch someone else."

I explores texture, contrast, and line, creating whimsical motifs, geometric patterns, and carved surfaces using sgraffito and mishima surface decorating techniques. My pots are meant to be used, their true beauty expressed through functionality. My work is collected by locals and visitors alike and can be found gracing many San Juan Island homes and restaurants, including Friday Harbor House, Duck Soup and Backdoor Kitchen. I have shown in national juried exhibitions and my studio is a regular on the San Juan Island Artists’ Studio Tour."

She aims to create aesthetically clean, unobtrusive objects that blend perfectly into their function and can be used without thinking.  This is not to say that she doesn't have a sense of humour when it comes to her work. She likes to break up the simplicity with quirky pieces that she hopes can bring a smile to the user. Her path to ceramics has had a few detours. She earned a BA in Classics (Latin and Ancient Greek) from the University of Calgary and had a career as a Registered Dental Technologist for nearly ten years until she chose to make a career change and travel to Stoke-on-Trent to study ceramic design at Staffordshire University, from which she received an MA in March 2013. While in the heart of the UK pottery industry, she started to take a greater interest in the harmonising and combining of craft and industrial ceramics. She is now back in Canada as Residency Coordinator at Medalta International Artists In Residence in Medicine Hat, Alberta, where she also has a studio."

I am interested in investigating the tradition of ceramics, its complex history, and the inherent qualities of ceramic materials. I am exploring how the properties of clay and the ceramic process contribute to my sculptures physically, conceptually and emotionally. Systems, order, randomness and chance are my base line of inquiry.  I employ these opposite attitudes, logical thinking/reasoning and spontaneity of play/intuition, to create work that offers multiple interpretations and meanings. In my process I employ rules of precision, careful design and craftsmanship, while also striving to generate an atmosphere of casualness and playfulness.  “To play” and “be playful” are, for me, serious activities. I have been exploring diversity in materials by using porcelain, stoneware, earthenware, glazes, glass, metal, 100% wool felt, silk & cotton, wood, plastic/3d printed objects, Plexiglas, rendering foam, latex & acrylic paint, found furniture, etc.  Each building element, derived from logic or chance, is assembled into geometric abstract compositions that recall the early stages of an architectural model or primordial architectonic structures. What I am interested in the ideation stage of models is their potentiality; it can be something and anything. While I investigate sculptural relationships of volume, surface, balance and tension, I contemplate the notions of natural balance, the unification of opposites and the interdependence of all things. What I look for is coincidences/bumps between the elements that create meaningful impact or relations, and I wait for the moment when the work appears to have become a self-contained unit of meaning that is open to multiple interpretations."

    "bio": "As a young potter’s apprentice in Japan, I spent years throwing and perfecting forms, to the point that my hands and body could create without the intervention of my conscious mind. When I began to consider my work in an intentional and creative way, I was driven by a quest to create new glazes. In Japan, I performed thousands of experiments with different materials and firing temperatures to achieve an iridescent glaze reminiscent of ancient Chinese yohen tenmoku tea bowls, dark and mysterious in a way that reminded me of a clear night’s endless sky. Coming to the United States thirty years ago to pursue my life as an artist, I knew that my forms and glazes needed to enhance each other. Clarity and simplicity of line are the most important formal elements to me, as they create unity with their surroundings and allow a pure canvas for the glaze. Every time the shape changes, the glaze looks so different. Recently, I have done more architectural shapes—squares and hexagons with sharp edges where the glaze transforms and pools in interesting ways. These forms are very difficult to make because the corners separate, and because they are made in different sections then fused together. The ratio of failure to success is very high. I have continued to be motivated by a search for new glazes and enjoy the years of trial and error required to achieve on the form what I imagine is possible in my mind. Two years ago, I began experimenting with bronze glazes that would have a striking, three-dimensional fractal design. Although the glaze looks textural and has visual depth, the surface is very smooth. Different chemicals and temperatures result in permutations of color from rich, quiet bronze to inky, soft grey (brought on by firing the pieces at the kiln’s maximum temperature). Other chemical additives to the glaze result in sparkling, diamond-like flecks inside the fractals. I want each piece to feel balanced with the environment, to feel as it co-exists naturally with its surroundings. The form directs the light and the eye, allowing the glaze, in turn, to shape the perception of form."

Several years later he was invited  to go to Korea to learn the traditional method of making large Onggi  storage jars with master Ongii potter Oh Hyang Jong. Upon returning from  Korea, Michael began setting up a studio and building a large  Thai-shaped wood kiln in the Penland area. Naomi began making pottery with her grandmother as a child. She  studied clay at Earlham College with Mike Theideman, a former apprentice  of Warren MacKenzie. She spent a semester in Mexico, where she studied  with Mexican potters and discovered pre-colombian clay figures. In  addition to making pottery, she began making sculptures inspired by  pre-colombian and Japanese Haniwa figures. After college, Naomi came to  Penland to take a kiln building class and met Michael, who was building a  kiln at his studio. Michael and Naomi discovered they shared a similar  passion and approach to making pottery. Now they work together as full  time potters, firing their kiln four times a year, and occasionally  teaching workshops. Their pottery is named “Bandana Pottery” after the  small community in which they live. They exhibit their work internationally."

I continue to be inspired by the intricacies of nature and the rich traditions of Majolica pottery. I love the meditative process of immersing myself in nature and sketching my observations. In the studio, I play with the sketches allowing historical influences and the pot form to enter into the design process. I admire the exotic form and ornamentation of Persian ceramics with its highly abstracted, imaginative, plant-derived designs. I also enjoy Spanish luster-ware with its lively, calligraphic brushwork and designs utilizing the interplay of positive and negative space. Ultimately, the process of pottery making is a means of connecting myself to the natural world, other cultures and artists before me, and to those who now find meaning in my work."

It was during her studies in the Skidmore College studio that she developed her unique technique for carving bas-relief porcelain pottery. She looks to Sung dynasty Chinese porcelains and American Arts and Crafts period artist Adelaide Robineau for her carving inspiration. Unlike these influences, she does not glaze her porcelain vessels, choosing rather to retain the sculptural quality of un-glazed porcelain enhanced by hand polishing. JoAnn finds inspiration in balancing her studio practice with teaching. She has taught in public schools, art centers, and colleges, most recently at Sage College in Albany, NY. JoAnn’s work has been included in invitational and juried exhibits throughout the United States, including the prestigious “Strictly Functional Pottery National”, Potter’s Council exhibit at the National Council on Education for The Ceramic Arts conference, and locally “The Artists of the Mohawk Hudson Region”.  Her work has appeared in Ceramics Monthly and Clay Times magazines, Surface Design for Ceramics  by Maureen Mills, Lark Books, 500 Raku, Lark Books, and she was recognized as an Emerging Artist by Ceramics Monthly Magazine Online Showcase in 2006."

    "bio": "I think of my work as a balancing act. Combinations of clean, spare forms and active, graphic surfaces. Light and dark. Figurative and abstract. Texture and Surface. I want to engage the narrative potential of seemingly simple natural forms to reflect the fluid, dynamic experiences of life. My aim to use the energy of these images and forms to connect the work with those who use it – whether as a large community mural or a delicate cup of tea. There are stories and experiences evoked by these pieces to be shared and built upon over time. My goal is to create work that invites the user to reflect on these possibilities while enjoying the piece through the simple pleasures of daily active use. My work has evolved over the years and has incorporated a variety of formats and mediums, but nature as a source of inspiration has remained a constant. My current pottery work uses a porcelain etched technique which allows me to focus on the transition of narrative images from figurative to abstract. I am interested in seeing the individual detail emerging from the complexity of an environment. A single grass reed dances out above the density of plants below. Birds, branches and leaves begin to flow into each other to the point of obscurity. These details echo our relationships as individuals within a social context. There is a play between support and isolation, connection and independence, clarity and confusion. These moments are not static. The scenes portrayed evolve as the piece is turned. I try to keep a sense of movement and time in the work. The density is balanced by an opening. Using this pottery on a daily basis not only reveals the details and personality of a piece, but also allows the user to build on the narrative involved. I try to create space and potential in my work for the user to engage with it on their own terms, to make it their own."

The textures gained by carving create variations in the glaze thickness and color. I make and sell the carving tools that give my pots a distinctive feel. Surface patterns are made with altered brushes and colored clay slips.  Most pieces have a single glaze that is fired in either a gas reduction or wood fired kilns. My introduction to clay in Japan nearly 30 years ago laid the foundation for my craft and art. My educational background in design, study of Japanese tea ceremony, and love of food all add to my functional ceramics — pottery that can be used every day and treasured as a work of art. Sculpturally, I create a variety of forms including incense burners inspired by Japanese and Mayan beast sculpture and study of animals at the zoo.  My more modernist sculptures are based on microscopic organisms. I have been an active part of the wood-firing community in New England for over 18 years and a teacher of clay for nearly 30. Currently I am teaching at Mudflat Pottery School and Harvard Ceramics."

Our collaborative work brings together the best of both worlds, while maintaining a rich expression of distinct voices. It’s the result of an intimacy and a trust wherein we “obey a third body that they share in common” (Robert Bly). The last 22 years together has produced an innovative blend and style in functional porcelain which best reveals the nuances of Nancy’s sophisticated eye as designer and decorator.

These agents also serve key roles in interacting with my ceramic vessels.  Mushrooms, seed pods, grubs and other growths serve as knobs and handles, allowing one to remove lids and discover what might be inside or underneath a covered vessel, like lifting a rock to have insects scurry in many different directions when subjected to the light of day. The vessels are not intended to be actual representations of the trees and rocks, but abstractions and stylizations of these natural phenomena. Employing an earthy background palette stretched across textured but quieter surfaces, I wanted to upset that quiet earthiness with intense splashes of vibrant color, patterns, and glossy surfaces not commonly associated with tree bark or the rough surfaces of rocks amidst fallen leaves.  I am interested in inflated volume and thick line qualities that reference comic style drawings and how that can apply to interpreting the natural world. With my ceramic vessels I hope to create a comic book interpretation of the natural world with a focus on the rocks and trees and their role in the perpetual organic comedy of growth and decay."

Over time I graduated to become a committed maker of high performance model gliders, drawn by their intricate, lightweight construction and serene patterns of flight. With this seeming to point to a career in aviation I went to Manchester University to study Aeronautical Engineering but soon realised that life in industry was not what I was after. After graduating I took a year off to travel in southern Asia, returning to train as a social worker and embark on what became a 20 year career as practitioner, manager and finally university lecturer. It was during this time that I started making pots, going to evening classes to unwind after work and to re-discover the absorbing pleasure and satisfaction of making. Evening classes lead to short courses and holiday courses and eventually, having discovered during this time the enjoyment of throwing and the magic of saltglazing, to acceptance onto the Workshop Ceramics degree course at the University of Westminster (Harrow). Three years at Harrow helped me develop a capacity to conceptualise and reflect on what I was doing as well as an understanding of how to translate an idea into an object. The course was structured to equip us with the skills for designing and making not only our work but also the kilns to fire it in. I discovered the architecture of Santiago Calatrava and Frank Gehry amongst others and I began using the wheel as a tool for making thrown shapes for manipulation and assembly into the architecturally influenced pieces that eventually formed the basis of my degree show. In ceramics I had at last found the professional stimulation that 25 years earlier I had hoped a career in the aircraft industry would provide me with. I graduated with a first in 1997 and the following year set up my present workshop in a converted former farm building in Broxbourne, Hertfordshire."

I work within the traditional role of a potter, which is to say, making pottery meant to be used. It is this craft that separates it from the other arts such as painting or sculpture. It is through the elements of touch and use that communication between the object and user occurs. I’m also interested in form which, in large part, is the art of pottery. The tactile qualities, the weight, and how the pots feel. In this age of increasing dependence on machine-made objects and the worship of technology, I feel it’s essential that handmade objects are used as a way for us to communicate with each other."

Pottery form, in its inherent relationship to the human body (i.e., lip, neck, belly), speaks to the viewer/user through anthropomorphic familiarity and an implication of direct physical contact.

In the late 1990s Ian decided to leave the northeast in search of a new perspective… the exact opposite of the northeast. He found himself as an art student at a small liberal arts college in North GA, where he was introduced to ceramics as a requirement for graduation. After his first ceramics class he was completely hooked. “Life in GA was uncomfortably slow for me, sitting at a potter’s wheel was the first thing I found in the south that helped calm my angst and direct my energy towards something creative”. Shortly after deciding to become a ceramics major, Ian found crystalline glazes. The challenge these glazes put forward created a lifelong passion for Ian. In 2005, Ian was accepted to the University of Massachusetts in Amherst as a graduate student in ceramics. He spent the next three years focused on research and development of his crystalline glazes. Since that time Ian has shown his work and conducted workshops extensively both internationally and nationally. In 2013 he was invited to attend a symposium in La Bisbal, Spain to show his work and give a lecture about his techniques in crystalline glazing to the international community. Most recently, Ian’s work and technique have been featured in the July/August 2016 issue of Pottery Making Illustrated. Ian is currently a Professor of Ceramics at Mississippi University for Women in Columbus, MS."

    "bio": "Through the lens of functional pottery I focus on questions about our relationship with objects. I explore the concept of humanity’s authority over landscape and record of construction as a form of time materialized. The geographical layered strata of each vessel represent fragments or glimpses into the density of every assemblage. With the intersections and overlaps, I contemplate the dynamic relationship between materiality and landscape and our attempt to utilize it. Each vessel is made using clay that is colored to reference vibrant natural tones found in the wilderness. My work has a desire to cultivate order and my pots are designed to manicure domestic space. Focusing on the fluidity of process and materials as remnants of making, I work with a limited number of tools and movements to allow the clay to actively inform the line quality and elegant volume. Relying heavily on the physicality of the technique I generously push and pull these lines to develop an undulation that resembles natural rhythms. The harmony of repetition comes through meditation of movement. The presence of process in the work is essential as my forms are searching for confidence in their construction. The conversation between the stained clay and glaze obscures or reveals a bodily response to a continuum between clay and ceramic."

After a year in England gaining a foundation in functional studio pottery, Kasten traveled to Kathmandu, Nepal, where she spent four years as head of a project for developing a stoneware ceramic facility for artisan potters in the village of Thimi, Nepal. Her training in England and her experiences in Nepal were a formative influence on Kasten’s ceramic sculpture and vessels, which draw on minimalist British studio ceramics, as well as hand-made antiquities created by indigenous peoples throughout Asia. Kasten greatly benefitted from sharing techniques and materials with artisans from far-flung cultures, and this has given rise to a unique artistic vocabulary that informs her own ceramic work. In 2005, Kasten established her studio in Oakland, California, where she shifted from making functional studio ceramics to also creating sculptural ceramics. In 2007 Kasten became an Artist in Residence at Red Dirt Studio in Mt. Rainier, MD, where she worked closely with artist Margaret Boozer. Here, she further developed her distinct combination of sculpture and vessel work, showing her ceramics nationally at galleries and fine craft shows. In 2012, she purchased an old shoe repair shop to house her studio as well as workspace for other artists. Kasten’s storefront studio and gallery, Artbar, was a draw for visitors and collectors, and became one of the neighborhood creative hotspots. In 2016, Kasten moved to the St. Croix River Valley, northeast of Minneapolis, Minnesota, where she is currently a host potter for the historic St. Croix Valley Pottery Tour. Kasten lives in Shafer, Minnesota, on a small farm with a house and barn where her studio and showroom are located. She continues to exhibit her work nationally and internationally in galleries and fine craft exhibitions."

Vessels built upon dynamic forms, diversely bodied clay and turbulent colorful wood-fired surfaces assert a continued geologic impact on our understanding of the conditions of contemporary life.     Creating ceramic vessels that share aspects of the geologic world and domestic space fascinates me. Smooth volumes, stressed surfaces, thick slashes, jagged edges and ripped segments of a vessel act as abstracted conduits to potent Earth features and physicality while not obliterating vessel space.  Compressing rugged forms with volume in this way evokes reactive spatial relationships. Ranges of color and texture built in the volatile atmosphere of a wood kiln extend connections to material diversity reflected in the world. Dynamic additive and subtractive layers of information, developed through forming and firing, reveals constantly shifting perspectives to massive geologic systems.     I make pottery that places massive tectonics within domestic, lived space. By exploring tensions between chaos and calm, I strive to uncover new ideas about uncontrollable dynamic forces and contained expanses."

    "bio": "Objects reflect ourselves. My porcelain pots are wheel thrown and feature meticulous carving in original patterns. I draw my inspiration from historical reticulated porcelain, reinterpreted with art nouveau inspired patterns, and filtered through a contemporary lens. After throwing and trimming I use a soft pencil to lay out a grid as a base for the design to be carved. I then sketch the pattern, starting with a simple series of arches and adding overlapping layers until I am satisfied with the aesthetics. Then I score each cut and evaluate the piece for structural strength. My carving tools are simple: a #11 Exacto blade, a pin tool, small sponges, and paintbrushes. Everything is terribly delicate before firing, but afterwards is durable enough for everyday, mindful use. I’ve found porcelain to be an ideal medium for exploring the duality of strength and delicacy. The almost-symmetrical patterns lend an enchanting elegance and heighten the perceived fragility to each overall form. The conversation between imperfection and beauty, power and acquiescence, strength and delicacy all resonate with my own humanity."

He came to the United States in 1963 to continue his studies at Chouinard Institute of Art when his introduction to Fred Marer drew him to sculptural ceramics. He proceeded to study with Peter Voulkos, Paul Soldner, and Jerry Rothman in California during the time now defined as The Contemporary Ceramics Movement in America. The following decade, Kaneko taught at some of the nation’s leading art schools, including Scripps College, Rhode Island School of Design and Cranbrook Academy of Art. Based in Omaha since 1986, Jun Kaneko has worked at several experimental studios including European Ceramic Work Center in The Netherlands, Otsuka Omi Ceramic Company in Japan, Fabric Workshop in Philadelphia PA, Bullseye Glass in Portland OR, Acadia Summer Arts Program in Bar Harbor ME, and Aguacate in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. Over the course of his career he has partnered with industrial facilities to realize large-scale, hand-built sculptures. The first was his 1982-1983 Omaha Project at Omaha Brickworks. Later sculptures include his Fremont Project, completed in 1992-1994, and most recently his Pittsburg Project completed in 2004-2007. Most recently, Jun has been working at the Cuernavaca Raku ceramics studio, experimenting with new glazes and the unpredictability of raku. Kaneko is increasingly drawn to installations that promote civic interaction; completing over sixty public art commissions, including a two three hundred and fifty foot long tile wall at Aquarium Station in Boston, MA (1993-2000), a three-story high wall in the Biology library at The University of Connecticut (1997), and an eighty-eight foot tall Glass Tower at the Buffett Cancer Center in Omaha, NE (2017); other large scale permanent installations can be seen in Osaka, Japan (1994), Kansas City, MO (2006), Des Moines, IA (2013), and at the International Finance Center in Shanghai, China (2012). His artwork appears in numerous international and national solo and group exhibitions annually, and is included in more than seventy museum collections. Kaneko holds honorary doctorates from the University of Nebraska, the Massachusetts College of Art & Design, and the Royal College of Art in London."

I learned basic welding and metalworking skills, as well as large scale concrete casting. I worked with this studio on and off for six years as I began studying Ceramic sculpture at San Francisco State University. I fell in love with ceramics because the material is so ancient and so human, but I wanted to learn how to work with it on a larger scale. I eventually met a potter named Mattie Leads who makes large scale pottery and incorporates it into the architecture of buildings. Working with Mattie helped me to increase the scale of my ceramics and has changed the way that I seek to incorporate ceramics into the environment. After graduating and pursuing my career as an artist I began working a lot with graphic Design, CNC operated machines, 3D modeling programs, and other types of technological mediums. I developed a studio process of working with technology so that it enhances tangible materials such as clay and the humanity of the media. I am always looking for opportunities to use more diverse mediums and create art that relates to the public on a deeper, more human level. The past two years I have been working as a full-time International muralist. This work has been rewarding because it has allowed me to contribute to diverse communities, and promote creative expression. Lately I have been working with a Gallery and a few different interior designers to start creating living wall art to promote environmental consciousness and healing."

Although on the surface it may seem like I feature animals because they are \"cute\", I feature them in order to honor them. Farm animals like chickens are a large portion of my work because I want to showcase a side of them that many people don't see. Chicken trucks packed from top to bottom with dirty, white birds drive past my house every day, and the sadness lingers longer than the odor. I want to show that animals like these chickens are more than ingredients tightly packed in plastic and polystyrene foam. I enjoy trying to capture their personalities, their curious yet judgmental eyes, and the way their beautiful feathers beg to be painted."

Here he was able to experiment in atmospheric firings and gained exponential growth in both technical and aesthetic decisions.  Following the end of his residency, he was awarded a summer resident position at the Archie Bray Foundation in Helena, MT.

It evokes the plastic nature of clay in its raw form, but also the movement associated with the pot's intended use. It reflects our beauty and awkward imperfections; imperfections that celebrate the handmade object over mass-produced, industrial ware. My pottery is inspired by many things, including the landscape around my home, the rich history of ceramics, but also by antique tinware, textured metal, and old things you might find in barns."

    "bio": "The challenge of the mold making process and the interaction of ceramic materials is what fuels my curiosity and keeps me active in the making process. My practice begins with carving models from plaster and augmenting found objects for positives. In these models I try to translate the gestures of animals, forms from nature and the swell and movement of cumulus clouds into functional shapes. A ceramic mold is then made from these models and caste in clay. Through adding elements together and multiple glaze firings the repetitious process is modified to create one of a kind functional pieces. Recently my work has deviated to include simplistic forms that are heavily reliant on repetitive mark making. In this process the goal is to focus only on the line directly before as a way to center concentration. Something about the repetitive motion that requires tunnel vision to stay on task I find meditative. Using mainly underglaze pencil and very fine underglaze applicators, the work is left unglazed or minimally glazed to create a textural experience when held in the hand. The end result are pieces that reflect on natural repetitious patterns in nature. It is though this investigation of everyday tableware I strive to make works of art that the owner will use, handle and enjoy. I would like there to be a tiny celebration everyday and I hope my objects can inspire that in their owners."

These pots are high fired in a gas reduction kiln.  Due to the nature of the minimally processed wild clay there are occasionally small rocks, fissures and iron specks, these occurrences do not compromise the function of the pot.  All the pots are carefully checked before going out to the world. All of the pots are functional and food safe. They are also dishwasher and microwave safe."

But decoration is no less important to me than form. I draw on my pots after bisque firing. I draw on pots almost like I would on paper. The fire leaves a final mark on the drawing, that is not entirely predictable. My vocabulary includes repetitive pattern, animals and domestic objects. My shapes, designs and images are contemporary, but draw from a long tradition of painted functional pots. Some influences I brought with me from my native Germany, where I grew up in Meissen and Dresden, an area with a very rich history of ceramic manufacturing."

Currently Perry lives and works out of his home studio in Clancy, Montana. My work expands with fluidity, balance, and how these two interact with one another. The love of the wood fire ceramic surface, particularly how unpredictable it is. Allowing it to express it self within the elements of the fire."

Specialising in the bespoke production of high fired stoneware tiles, they have to date carried out a range of commissions for a variety of notable architects and designers. This includes a unique collaboration with Kate Malone and EPR Architects on 24 Savile Row and a collaboration with Jamie Fobert Architects on the new Pavilion at the Tate St Ives.   Richard has a passion for clay and continues his own studio practice, exhibiting his ceramics at selected shows.  More recently Richard fulfilled the role of ceramics technician on the BBC 2 programme ‘The great Pottery Throwdown’.  Richard's work makes reference to historical design patterns. It draws on themes of British colonialism and the way in which the U.K. has become an eclectic mix of cultural styles, as immigration has brought with it a rich source of influence . Images associated with the colonies, that have become adopted by the British mainstream are the core influence on Richard's practice."

    "bio": "Kadri Pärnamets works in porcelain using traditional hand building and sculpting techniques to combine surface and form with narrative painting. Her biomorphic, organic forms provide a means to convey personal interests ranging from the fragile, natural environment to female identity. Focusing on gesture and expression, she selects known classics of female beauty by painters from the European Renaissance and Impressionist eras, like Lucas Cranach the Elder and Edouard Manet. Pärnamets has taught in the Estonian Art Academy and is a member of the Asuurkeraamika Studio, Estonian Artists Association, and Estonian Ceramist Association. Pärnamets’ work has been shown internationally at Ferrin Contemporary, (North Adams, MA), the Estonian Museum of Applied Art and Design, (Tallinn, Estonia), and at the International Tea Trade Expo, (Shanghai, China). Since 1996, she has participated in symposiums in Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Switzerland, USA, Norway, and Hungary. In Pärnamets graduated from the Art Institute of Tallinn, Estonia in 1994 with a BA/MFA in Ceramics. Dividing her time between Estonia and USA, her primary studio is the USA at Project Art in Cummington, MA. She is represented by Ferrin Contemporary."

My ceramic sculpture serves as a metaphor for a wider global panorama of political power and industrial production. I am currently exploring the lineage of manifest destiny, from its beginnings in Europe to westward expansion in America, to forms it has taken in modern America. These ceramic forms serve as the conceptual grounds upon which to explore industry and culture. In these works I simultaneously celebrate the history of the pastoral life while questioning the ideologies of modern society. Through hand-labor, contemplative making, and a reverence for tradition, I aim to explore both interrelated and divergent human perceptions using clay as my primary medium."
